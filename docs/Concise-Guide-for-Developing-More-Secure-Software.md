# Concise Guide for Developing More Secure Software 2022-08-26

Here is a concise guide for all software developers for software development, building, and distribution.

1. **Ensure all privileged developers use** [**multi-factor authentication (MFA) tokens**](https://github.com/ossf/great-mfa-project/blob/main/guide/token-usage-guide.md). This includes those with commit or accept privileges. MFA hinders attackers from “taking over” these accounts.
2. **Learn about secure software development.** Take, e.g., the [free OpenSSF course](https://openssf.org/training/courses/) or the hands-on [Security Knowledge Framework](https://www.securityknowledgeframework.org/) course. [SAFECode’s Fundamental Practices](https://safecode.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SAFECode_Fundamental_Practices_for_Secure_Software_Development_March_2018.pdf)[for Secure Software Development](https://safecode.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SAFECode_Fundamental_Practices_for_Secure_Software_Development_March_2018.pdf) provides a helpful summary.
3. **Use a combination of tools in your CI pipeline to detect vulnerabilities**. See the [OpenSSF guide to security tools](https://github.com/ossf/wg-security-tooling/blob/main/guide.md). Tools shouldn’t be the _only_ mechanism, but they scale.
4. **Evaluate software before selecting it as a direct dependency**. Only add it if needed, evaluate it (see [Concise Guide for Evaluating Open Source Software](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/blob/main/docs/Concise-Guide-for-Evaluating-Open-Source-Software.md)), double-check its name (to counter typosquatting), and ensure it’s retrieved from the correct repository.
5. **Use package managers**. Use package managers (system, language-level, and/or container-level) to automatically manage dependencies and enable rapid updates.
6. **Implement automated tests**. Include negative tests (tests that what shouldn’t happen doesn’t happen) and ensure the test suite is thorough enough to “ship if it passes the tests”.
7. **Monitor known vulnerabilities in your software’s direct & indirect dependencies**. E.g., enable basic scanning via GitHub's [dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-security-updates/configuring-dependabot-security-updates) or GitLab [dependency scanning](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/). Many other third party Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools are also available. Quickly update vulnerable dependencies. 
8. **Keep dependencies reasonably up-to-date**. Otherwise, it’s hard to update for vulnerabilities.
9. **Do not push secrets to a repository**. Use tools to detect pushing secrets to a repository.
10. **Review before accepting changes**. Enforce it, e.g., [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches)or [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/protected_branches.html)protected branches.
11. **Prominently document how to report vulnerabilities & prepare for them**. Use resources like the [Guide to coordinated vulnerability disclosure](https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide). Create a [security policy](https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/tree/main/templates/security_policies). Provide contacts.
12. **Make it easy for your users to update**. Implement stable APIs, e.g., support old names when new ones are added. Use semantic versioning. Have a deprecation process.
13. **Sign your project’s important releases**. Use standard tools and signing formats for your distribution. See the [cosign tool](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview) from the [sigstore project](https://www.sigstore.dev/) to sign containers and other artifacts.
14. [**Earn an OpenSSF Best Practices badge**](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/) for your open source project. At least earn “passing”. Plan and roadmap to eventually earn silver & gold.
15. **Improve your** [**OpenSSF Scorecards**](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard) **score (if OSS and on GitHub)**. You can read the [Scorecards checks](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard#scorecard-checks). Use the [Allstar](https://github.com/ossf/allstar) monitor.
16. **Notify the community of vulnerabilities in your project.** Publish security advisories with accurate & precise information, e.g., what usage & versions are vulnerable, mitigations, and fixed version(s). Get a CVE ID. On GitHub, [create your security advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/repository-security-advisories/creating-a-repository-security-advisory#creating-a-security-advisory) & [request a CVE](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/repository-security-advisories/about-github-security-advisories-for-repositories#cve-identification-numbers).
17. **Improve your** [**Supply chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA)**](https://slsa.dev/) **level**. This hardens the integrity of your build and distribution process against attacks.
18. **Publish and consume a software bill of materials (SBOM)**. This lets users verify inventory, id known vulnerabilities, & id potential legal issues. Consider [**SPDX**](https://spdx.dev/) or [**CycloneDX**](https://cyclonedx.org/).
19. **Onboard your project into** [**LFX Security**](https://security.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/) **if you manage a Linux Foundation project**.
20. **Apply the** [**CNCF Security TAG Software Supply Chain Best Practices guide**](https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/blob/main/supply-chain-security/supply-chain-security-paper/CNCF_SSCP_v1.pdf).
21. **Implement** [**ASVS**](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/) **and follow relevant** [**cheatsheets**](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/index.html).
22. **Apply SAFECode’s** [**Fundamental Practices for Secure Software Development**](https://safecode.org/uncategorized/fundamental-practices-secure-software-development/).
23. **Complete a third-party security code review/audit**. Expect this to be USD$50K or more.
24. **Continuously improve**. Improve scores, look for tips, & apply as appropriate.
25. **Manage succession**. Have clear governance & work to add active, trustworthy maintainer(s).
