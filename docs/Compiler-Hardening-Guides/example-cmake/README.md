# CMake Compiler Hardening Example

Demonstrates compiler hardening flags in a CMake project. Uses Docker to ensure a consistent build environment with modern compilers (GCC 14 and Clang 19 on Ubuntu 24.04).

Docker is required. All compilation and execution happens within a container.

Run `make help` to see available commands.
