# Compiler Annotations for C and C++

Compile time security analysis and runtime mitigation implemented in compilers both depend on the compiler being able to see the flow of data between different points in a program, across functions and modules. This is quite a challenge in C and C++ because both languages allow passing around opaque references, thus losing information about objects.  To work around this problem, both GCC and Clang implement attributes to annotate source code, especially functions and data structures, to allow them to do better analysis of source code.  These annotations are not only beneficial for security, but they also help the compilers make better optimization decisions, often resulting in better code.

## Attributes at a glance

Both GCC and Clang recognize the `__attribute__` keyword to annotate source code.  Both compilers also provide a `__has_attribute()` macro function that returns 1 if the attribute name passed to it is supported and 0 otherwise.  For example `__has_attribute(malloc)` would return 1 in the latest GCC and Clang.  The full syntax description for the `__attribute__` keyword is available in the GCC documentation[^GCCATTR].

The C++11[^CPP11] and C23[^C23] standards specify a new attribute specifier sequence to standardize the `__attribute__` functionality. The syntax is simply `[[prefix::attribute]]`, where the `prefix` specifies the namespace (e.g. `gnu` for a number of attributes described in this document) and `attribute` is the name of the attribute. This style is recommended whenever it is possible to build your applications to target these standards.

When declaring functions, attributes may be added to the function at the end of the declaration, like so:

~~~c
extern void *custom_allocator (size_t sz) [[gnu::malloc]] [[alloc_size (1)]];
~~~

At function definition, function attributes come right before the function name:

~~~c
void * [[gnu::malloc]] [[gnu::alloc_size (1)]] custom_allocator (size_t sz);
~~~

Some function attributes can accept parameters that have specific meanings.  Parameters can be numbers that indicate the position of the argument to the function; 1 indicates the first argument, 2 the second and so on.  Parameters can also be keywords or names of identifiers that have been declared earlier in the program.

## Performance considerations

Attributes influence not only diagnostics generated by the compiler but also the resultant code. As a result, annotating code with attributes will have an impact on performance, although the impact may go either way.  The annotation may allow compilers to add more traps for additional security and be conservative about some optimizations, thus impacting performance of output code. At the same time however, it may allow compilers to make some favorable optimization decisions, resulting in generation of smaller and faster running code and often, better code layout.

### Mark custom allocation and deallocation functions

| <span id="malloc">`malloc`</span>                                                           | GCC 2.95.3<br/>Clang 13.0.0 | Function                     | Mark custom allocation functions that return non-aliased (possibly NULL) pointers.                |

| <span id="malloc (dealloc, ptr-index)">`malloc (`_`deallocator`_`,` _`ptr-index`_`)`</span> | GCC 11.0.0                  | Function                     | Same as above but also denotes the positional argument here the pointer must be passed.           |

The `malloc` attribute in GCC and Clang indicates that the function acts like a memory allocation function, meaning it returns a pointer to allocated storage that is disjoint (non-aliased) from the storage for any other object accessible to the caller.

Using the attribute with no arguments is designed to allow the compiler to rely on that the returned pointer does not alias any other valid pointers at the time of return and does not contain pointers to existing objects for program optimization. Functions like `malloc` and `calloc` have this property because they return a pointer to uninitialized or zeroed-out, newly obtained storage. However, functions like `realloc` do not have this property, as they may return pointers to storage containing pointers to existing objects. Additionally, GCC uses the `malloc` attribute to infer that the marked function returns null only infrequently, allowing callers to be optimized based on that assumption.

In GCC, the `malloc (`_`deallocator`_`)` and `malloc (`_`deallocator`_`,` _`ptr-index`_`)` forms associate the pointer returned by the marked function with the specified _`deallocator`_ function. Here, _`deallocator`_ is a function name that must have been declared before it can be referenced in the attribute and _`ptr-index`_ denotes the positional argument to _`deallocator`_ where the pointer must be passed in order to deallocate the storage. Using these forms of the `malloc` attribute interact with GCC’s static analyzer (`-fanalyzer`) to allow it to catch:

- **Mismatched deallocation** (`-Wanalyzer-mismatching-deallocation`) if there is an execution path in which the result of an allocation call is passed to a different _`deallocator`_.
- **Double free** (`-Wanalyzer-double-free`) if there is an execution path in which a value is passed more than once to a deallocation call.
- **Null pointer dereference** (`-Wanalyzer-possible-null-dereference`) if there are execution paths in which an unchecked result of an allocation call is dereferenced or passed to a function requiring a non-null argument.
- **Use-after-free** (`-Wanalyzer-use-after-free`) if there is an execution path in which the memory passed by pointer to a deallocation call is used after the deallocation.
- **Memory leaks** (`-Wanalyzer-malloc-leak`) if if there is an execution path in which the result of an allocation call goes out of scope without being passed to the deallocation function.
- **Invalid free** (`-Wanalyzer-free-of-non-heap`) if a deallocation function is used on a global or on-stack variable.

#### Example usage

GCC `malloc`, `malloc (`_`deallocator`_`)`, and `malloc (`_`deallocator`_, _`ptr-index`_`)`:

~~~c
void my_free(void *);

// Denotes that my_malloc will return with a dynamically allocated piece of memory which must be freed using my_free.
__attribute__ ((malloc, malloc (my_free, 1)))
void *my_malloc(size_t);
~~~

Note that to benefit both from the associated optimizations and improved detection of memory errors functions should be marked with _both_ the form of the attribute without arguments and the form of the attribute with one or two arguments.
