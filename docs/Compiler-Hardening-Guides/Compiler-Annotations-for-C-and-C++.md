# Compiler Annotations for C and C++

Compile time security analysis and runtime mitigation implemented in compilers both depend on the compiler being able to see the flow of data between different points in a program, across functions and modules. This is quite a challenge in C and C++ because both languages allow passing around opaque references, thus losing information about objects.  To work around this problem, both GCC and Clang implement attributes to annotate source code, especially functions and data structures, to allow them to do better analysis of source code.  These annotations are not only beneficial for security, but they also help the compilers make better optimization decisions, often resulting in better code.

## Attributes at a glance

Both GCC and Clang recognize the `__attribute__` keyword to annotate source code.  Both compilers also provide a `__has_attribute()` macro function that returns 1 if the attribute name passed to it is supported and 0 otherwise.  For example `__has_attribute(malloc)` would return 1 in the latest GCC and Clang.  The full syntax description for the `__attribute__` keyword is available in the GCC documentation[^GCCATTR].

The C++11[^CPP11] and C23[^C23] standards specify a new attribute specifier sequence to standardize the `__attribute__` functionality. The syntax is simply `[[prefix::attribute]]`, where the `prefix` specifies the namespace (e.g. `gnu` for a number of attributes described in this document) and `attribute` is the name of the attribute. This style is recommended whenever it is possible to build your applications to target these standards.

When declaring functions, attributes may be added to the function at the end of the declaration, like so:

~~~c
extern void *custom_allocator (size_t sz) [[gnu::malloc]] [[alloc_size (1)]];
~~~

At function definition, function attributes come right before the function name:

~~~c
void * [[gnu::malloc]] [[gnu::alloc_size (1)]] custom_allocator (size_t sz);
~~~

Some function attributes can accept parameters that have specific meanings.  Parameters can be numbers that indicate the position of the argument to the function; 1 indicates the first argument, 2 the second and so on.  Parameters can also be keywords or names of identifiers that have been declared earlier in the program.

Table 1: Recommended attributes

| Attribute                                         |       Supported by    | Type     | Description                                                                         |
|:------------------------------------------------- |:---------------------:|:--------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `malloc`                                          | GCC<br/>Clang 13 | Function | Allocator that returns a non-aliased (possibly NULL) pointer.                   |
| `malloc (dealloc)`                                | GCC 11 | Function | Same as above but also associate `dealloc` as the deallocator for this function |
| `alloc_size(pos)`<br/>`alloc_size(pos-1, pos-2)`  | GCC <br/>Clang | Function | Size of the object that the returned pointer points to is at argument `pos` of the function or product of arguments at `pos-1` and `pos-2`. |
| `access(mode, ref-pos)`<br/>`access(mode, ref-pos, size-pos)`  | GCC 10 | Function | Indicate how the function uses argument at `ref-pos`.  `mode` could be `read_only`, `read_write`, `write_only` or `none`.  `size-pos`, if mentioned, is the argument indicating the size of object at `ref-pos`. |
| `fd_arg(N)`                                          | GCC 13 | Function | Argument N is an open file descriptor.                   |
| `fd_arg_read(N)`                                          | GCC 13 | Function | Argument N is an open file descriptor that can be read from.                   |
| `fd_arg_write(N)`                                          | GCC 13 | Function | Argument N is an open file descriptor that can be written to.                   |
| `noreturn`                                          | GCC<br/>Clang | Function | The function does not return.                   |
| `tainted_args`                                          | GCC 12 | Function or function pointer | Function needs sanitization of its arguments. Used by -fanalyzer=taint                  |

## Performance considerations

Attributes influence not only diagnostics generated by the compiler but also the resultant code. As a result, annotating code with attributes will have an impact on performance, although the impact may go either way.  The annotation may allow compilers to add more traps for additional security and be conservative about some optimizations, thus impacting performance of output code. At the same time however, it may allow compilers to make some favorable optimization decisions, resulting in generation of smaller and faster running code and often, better code layout.
