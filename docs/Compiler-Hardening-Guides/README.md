# Compiler Hardening Guides

This is the working area for Compiler hardening best practices guide.  The [C/C++ Compiler Hardening](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/blob/main/docs/Compiler-Hardening-Guides/Compiler-Options-Hardening-Guide-for-C-and-C%2B%2B.md) document is currently work-in-progress and in incubation state.

## Scope and Objectives

This document is a guide for compiler and linker options that contribute to delivering reliable and secure code using native (or cross) toolchains for C and C++.
The objective of compiler options hardening is to produce application binaries (executables) with security mechanisms against potential attacks and/or misbehavior.

## Usage in Tools

A python script is also provided (in the `compiler-options-scraper` directory) that can fetch the latest version of the OpenSSF compiler hardening guide from the internet, obtain the recommended options tables from it and convert them to a machine readable JSON for usage in tools.

## How to Contribute

Contributions to the guide are always welcome, for instance:

* documentation of additional, currently not yet covered, compiler options which improve the security of binaries,
* documentation of similar/equivalent options of other (widely used) compilers which are currently not yet covered by this guide,
* improvements of the existing text

The group of authors meets online every other week to discuss open items and work on the doucment.
The [meeting details](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/tree/main#meeting-times) can be found in the main [README](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/blob/main/README.md) of the Best Practices Working Group.

Pull requests as always welcome!

### Guide Conventions

* Mention versions for compilers/dependencies in the "Supported Since" column until patch version (example: 2.95.3)
* Mention pre-requisite options in the "Description" column as the last statement, starting the statement with "Requires" keyword (example: see `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3` in the recommended compiler options table)
