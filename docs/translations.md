# Translations

We are *delighted* that people are willing to work to translate materials
into various languages such as Japanese. Here is how we review translation PRs
in this repo to ensure translations are good ones.

## Translation review process

To ensure that translations are good ones:

1. All pull requests (PRs) that add or modify a translation
   *must* be labeled as such.
   The label is the language name, e.g., "Japanese" for Japanese.
   Anyone can add that label, including the originator,
   if the repository permissions allow it.
   This way, missing labels can be easily added.
2. A member of the "trusted translation team" for that language
   will review those PRs for translation accuracy. At least one
   such member MUST approve the PR before it can be merged.
   If the PR comes *from* one if its team members, it's presumed to be
   approved by that team.
   If the label is wrong, a trusted translation team member
   should remove the label.
3. Someone else will also review the PR for any other issues,
   using the usual review processes, and indicate it's approved
   if it's approved.

Whenever both a trusted translation team member approves (2) AND it's
been approved otherwise (3), in any order, the PR can be merged.

## Trusted translation team members

Here are the trusted translation team members for each language,
including their name and GitHub id.
Any member of a trusted translation team can add other members to their team.

The OpenSSF TAC or Best Practices WG can create and remove teams,
and can add or remove members in such teams. In practice we expect anything
other than creating a team to be rare events for them.
