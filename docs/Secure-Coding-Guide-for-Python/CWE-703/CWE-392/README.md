# CWE-392: Missing Report of Error Condition

Failure to provide a mechanism for reporting that tasks in a thread pool failed as a result of an exceptional condition can make it difficult or impossible to diagnose the problem.

**ThreadPoolExecutor** from the `concurrent.futures` module is used in Python to asynchronously execute callable tasks [[Python Docs - concurrent.futures]](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html). The `ThreadPoolExecutor` suppresses exceptions raised by tasks to ensure that the failure of a task does not result in the failure of a worker thread in the thread pool. Otherwise, worker threads would close whenever an exception is raised, negatively impacting the performance of the `ThreadPoolExecutor`.

## Non-Compliant Code Example (submit)

One of the ways of running a task with `ThreadPoolExecutor` is using a `submit()` function. The function returns a Future object, which represents the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. Without calling the `result()` function on the Future object, any exceptions raised during the task will not appear. In the below example, the function `get_sqrt()` will raise a `ValueError` when trying to calculate a square root of a negative number [[Python Docs - Errors and Exceptions]](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#handling-exceptions). However, no Exception will be raised during the code execution.

*[noncompliant01.py](noncompliant01.py):*

```py
""" Non-compliant Code Example """
import math
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor


def get_sqrt(a):
    return math.sqrt(a)


def run_thread(var):
    with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        return executor.submit(get_sqrt, var)

#####################
# exploiting above code example
#####################
# get_sqrt will raise ValueError that will be suppressed by the ThreadPoolExecutor
arg = -1
result = run_thread(arg)  # The outcome of the task is unknown
```

## Compliant Solution (exception() method)

In order to determine whether an exception occurred, we can call the `exception()` method of the Future object. It returns the exception that was raised during the task execution or None if no exception was raised. It is important to note that **`exception()` does not raise the exception**, thus it cannot be caught in a `try … except` statement.

*[compliant01.py](compliant01.py):*

```py
""" Compliant Code Example """
import math
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor


def get_sqrt(a):
    return math.sqrt(a)


def run_thread(var):
    with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        future = executor.submit(get_sqrt, var)
        if future.exception() is not None:
            # handle exception...
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid argument: {var}")
        return future


#####################
# exploiting above code example
#####################
arg = -1
result = run_thread(arg)  # Now code execution will be interrupted by ValueError
```

## Compliant Solution (result() method)

The exception that was suppressed by the ThreadPoolExecutor will also be raised upon calling the `result()` method on the Future object. Since the exception is raised, it can be handled using the `try … except` statement.

*[compliant02.py](compliant02.py):*

```py
""" Compliant Code Example """
import math
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor


def get_sqrt(a):
    return math.sqrt(a)


def run_thread(var):
    with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        future = executor.submit(get_sqrt, var)
        try:
            res = future.result()
            return res
        except ValueError as e:
            # handle exception...
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid argument: {var}") from None


#####################
# exploiting above code example
#####################
arg = -1
result = run_thread(arg)  # Now code execution will be interrupted by ValueError
```

A similar example of using the `result()` and `exception()` methods to handle exceptions in the Future objects can be found at [[Ross 2020]](https://skeptric.com/python-futures-exception/index.html).

## Non-Compliant Code Example (map)

Alternatively, the asynchronous tasks can be run by the ThreadPoolExecutor using the `map()` function, which takes the function that should be run and an iterable collection of its parameters. `map()` creates a separate thread for each set of parameters in the given collection. Instead of a Future object, it returns all the task results in an iterator. The iterator maintains the order of submitted tasks - the first task that raises an exception will cause the iterator to be aborted and further results will not be generated.

*[noncompliant02.py](noncompliant02.py):*

```py
""" Non-compliant Code Example """

import math
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor


def get_sqrt(a):
    return math.sqrt(a)


def map_threads(x):
    with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        return executor.map(get_sqrt, x)


#####################
# exploiting above code example
#####################

# get_sqrt will raise ValueError that will be suppressed by the ThreadPoolExecutor
args = [2, -1, 4]
results = map_threads(args)
for result in results:
    print(result)  # Unhandled ValueError will be raised before all results are read
```

## Compliant Solution (Custom exception handling)

Since an exception is raised during iterating over the results, we can handle the exception using the `try … except` statement.

*[compliant03.py](compliant03.py):*

```py
""" Compliant Code Example """

import math
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor


def get_sqrt(a):
    return math.sqrt(a)


def map_threads(x):
    with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        result_gen = executor.map(get_sqrt, x)
        ret = list()
        invalid_arg = 0
        try:
            for res in result_gen:
                ret.append(res)
                invalid_arg += 1
            return res
        except ValueError as e:
            # handle exception...
            raise ValueError(
                f"Invalid argument: {x[invalid_arg]} at list index {invalid_arg}"
            ) from None


#####################
# exploiting above code example
#####################
args = [2, -1, 4]
results = map_threads(args)
for result in results:
    print(
        result
    )  # The exception is handled, but the rest of the results are still unavailable
```

Even after handling the exception, the results of tasks submitted after the erroneous task are still not available. If we were to iterate over the results manually using the `next()` method, we could see that after the task exception, a StopIterator is also raised. This terminates the result generator's useful life, which means further results will not be generated. This mechanism was described in [[PEP 0255]](https://peps.python.org/pep-0255/#specification-generators-and-exception-propagation).

If we want to make sure all task results will be available, we can either avoid using `map()` by using `submit()` instead, or we can ensure no unhandled exception will be raised within the executed task.

*[compliant04.py](compliant04.py):*

```py
""" Compliant Code Example """

import math
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor


def get_sqrt(a):
    try:
        return math.sqrt(a)
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Invalid argument: {a}")
        return None


def map_threads(x):
    with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        return executor.map(get_sqrt, x)


#####################
# exploiting above code example
#####################
args = [2, -1, 4]
results = map_threads(args)
for result in results:
    print(result)  # Now no exception is raised and we can read all of the results
```
