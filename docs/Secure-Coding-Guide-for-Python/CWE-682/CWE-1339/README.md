# CWE-1339: Insufficient Precision or Accuracy of a Real Number

Avoid floating-point and use integers or the `decimal` module to ensure precision in applications that require high accuracy, such as in financial or banking computations.

In Python, floating-point types are constrained by a fixed number of binary mantissa bits, typically allowing for around seven decimal digits of precision (24-bit values). Consequently, they are not well-suited for representing surds, such as `√7` or `π` with full accuracy. Additionally, due to their binary nature, floating-point types are incapable of exactly terminating decimals in `base 10`, such as `0.3`, which has a repeating binary representation.

To ensure precision in applications requiring high accuracy, such as in financial or banking computations, it is recommended to avoid using floating-point types. Instead, integers or more precise data types like the `Decimal` class should be employed.

## Non-compliant Code Example

This `noncompliant01.py` demonstrates the use of floating-point arithmetic to simulate purchasing items and subsequent

*[noncompliant01.py](noncompliant01.py):*

```py
# SPDX-FileCopyrightText: OpenSSF project contributors

""" Non-compliant Code Example """
BALANCE = 3.00
ITEM_COST = 0.33
ITEM_COUNT = 5
print(
    f"{str(ITEM_COUNT)} items bought, ${ITEM_COST} each. "
    f"Current account balance: "
    f"${str(BALANCE - ITEM_COUNT * ITEM_COST)}"
)
```

The unprecise `base 10` representation during the multiplication of `5` with `0.33`  results in an `account balance`  of  `$1.34999999999999993` in the `noncompliant01.py` code.

**Example noncompliant01.py output:**

```bash
5 items bought, $0.33 each. Current account balance: $1.34999999999999993
```

## Compliant Solution (Integer)

This compliant solution adheres more to standards by representing the account balance and item cost as `integers` in cents instead of using dollars. This approach eliminates the imprecision associated with floating-point numbers:

*[compliant01.py](compliant01.py):*

""" Non-compliant Code Example """
BALANCE = 300
ITEM_COST = 33
ITEM_COUNT = 5
print(
    f"{str(ITEM_COUNT)} items bought, ${ITEM_COST / 100} each. "
    f"Current account balance: "
    f"${str((BALANCE - ITEM_COUNT * ITEM_COST) / 100)}"
)
```

**Example `compliant01.py` output:**

```bash
5 items bought, $0.33 each. Current account balance: $1.35
```

## Compliant Solution (Decimal)

This compliant solution adheres to standards by utilizing the imported `Decimal` type, which allows for precise representation of decimal values. It's important to note that, on most platforms, calculations using `Decimal` tend to be less efficient compared to those using basic data types.

    f"Current account balance: "
    F"${str(BALANCE - ITEM_COUNT * ITEM_COST)}"
)
```

**Example `compliant02.py` output:**

```bash
5 items bought, $0.33 each. Current account balance: $1.35
```
