## OSS Project Evaluation

* [Security Scorecard](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard) - automated scoring of OSS projects
* [OpenSSF Best Practices badge](https://www.bestpractices.dev/) - a way for Free/Libre/Open Source Software projects to show that they follow best practices (you can also see its [source code repository](https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge)).

## Ongoing work

The OpenSSF Best Practices WG is working on many more materials, such as
more educational materials through our education special interest group (SIG),
compiler hardening guides,
guidance about memory safety through our memory safety SIG, and so on.

Examples of ongoing work include:

* [Secure Coding One Stop Shop for Python](Secure-Coding-Guide-for-Python/readme.md)
* [Compiler Annotations for C and C++](Compiler-Hardening-Guides/Compiler-Annotations-for-C-and-C++.md)

We typically use the [Simplest Possible Process (SPP)](https://best.openssf.org/spp/Simplest-Possible-Process) to publish our results on the web.
