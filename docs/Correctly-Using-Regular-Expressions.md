# Correctly Using Regular Expressions for Secure Input Validation

by the OpenSSF Best Practices Working Group

## Introduction

A key part of developing secure software is input validation, that is, validating that untrusted input (at least) is checked so that _only_ valid data is accepted. For example, if a value is supposed to be an integer, then the software must _only_ accept integers for that value and reject anything else. Sometimes a particular data type (like an integer or email address) is so common that libraries and frameworks include validators for them; in such cases, consider using them. However, many applications have application-specific patterns that also need input validation.

Regular expressions (aka regexes) _can_ be a great way to validate input against specialized patterns. They’re widely available, widely understood, flexible, and efficient. However, they must be used _correctly_. A lot of advice is _wrong_ or _omits key points_. In particular:

1. _Only_ data that _completely_ matches that pattern should be accepted (by using a “fullmatch” or by adding the correct anchors at the pattern’s beginning and end).
2. The “&#x7c;” operator, which lets you list alternatives, has an operator precedence that requires developers to parenthesize the set of alternatives when using it for input validation.
3. Regex language syntax _varies_ between different platforms; it is _not_ standard. In particular, the “$” anchor does _not_ only match the end of the string in Python and PHP, but it _does_ in JavaScript. You _must_ use the correct symbols for the platform you’re using. Developers reusing a regex from the Internet must _translate_ it to its target platform.

Doing input validation wrong, such as incorrectly using “^” or “$”, _could_ lead to vulnerabilities.

## Guidance

When using regexes for secure validation of untrusted input, do the following so they’ll be correctly interpreted:

1. Where possible, use a method, function, or flag that requires that the pattern _only_ match if it matches the _entire_ input. For example, in Python3 (but not Python2), use re.fullmatch for input validation when practical.
2. If you can’t do that:
    1. If there are any branches (“&#x7c;”), make sure the alternatives are grouped. You can do this by surrounding them with parentheses like this: “(aa&#x7c;bb)”. If you don’t need the groups to be captured (you usually don’t), and your platform supports non-capturing groups (most do), it’s usually more efficient to use non-capturing groups - just change “(“ into “(?:”
    2. Use a regular expression in its normal mode (not “multiline” mode). Prepend a start-of-string marking (often “^” or “\A”) and append an “end-of-string” marking (often “$” or “\z”, but Python uses “\Z”). Do _not_ use “$” for input validation until you verify that “$” does what you want. See this table for many common platforms:

   <td>Yes

   <td>“\z” or “$”
   </td>
   <td>No
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Python
   </td>
   <td>“^” or “\A”
   </td>
   <td>“\Z” (not “$” nor “\z”)
   </td>
   <td>No
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Ruby
   </td>
   <td>“\A” (not “^”)
   </td>
   <td>“\z” (not “$”)
   </td>
   <td>No
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

For example, to validate in JavaScript that the input is only “ab” or “de”, use the regex “<tt>^(ab&#x7c;de)$</tt>”. To validate the same thing in Python, use “<tt>^(ab&#x7c;de)\Z</tt>” or “<tt>\A(ab&#x7c;de)\Z</tt>”. Note that the “$” anchor has different meanings among platforms and is often misunderstood; on many platforms it’s permissive and doesn’t match only the end of the input. Instead of using “$” on a platform if $ is permissive, consider using an explicit form instead (e.g., “`\n?\z`”). Consider preferring “\A” and “\z” where it’s supported (this is necessary when using Ruby).

In addition, ensure your regex is not vulnerable to a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack. A ReDoS “[is a Denial of Service attack, that exploits the fact that most Regular Expression implementations may reach extreme situations that cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS)”. Many regex implementations are “backtracking” implementations, that is, they try all possible matches. In these implementations,  a poorly-written regular expression can be exploited by an attacker to take a vast amount of time.

1. One solution is to use a regex implementation that does not have this vulnerability because it never backtracks. E.g., use Go’s default regex system, RE2, or on .NET enable the RegexOptions.NonBacktracking option. Non-backtracking implementations can sometimes be orders of magnitude faster, but they also omit some features (e.g., backreferences).
2. Alternatively, create regexes that require no or little backtracking. Where a branch (“&#x7c;”) occurs, the next character should select one branch. Where there is optional repetition (e.g., “&#x2a;”), the next character should determine if there is a repetition or not. One common cause of unnecessary backtracking are poorly-written regexes with repetitions in repetitions, e.g., “(a+)&#x2a;”. Some tools can help find these defects.
3. A partial countermeasure is to greatly limit the length of the untrusted input. This can limit the impact of a vulnerability.
