Cairo Variable Font
===================

This download contains Cairo as both a variable font and static fonts.

Cairo is a variable font with these axes:
  slnt
  wght

This means all the styles are contained in a single file:
  Cairo-VariableFont_slnt,wght.ttf

If your app fully supports variable fonts, you can now pick intermediate styles
that aren’t available as static fonts. Not all apps support variable fonts, and
in those cases you can use the static font files for Cairo:
  static/Cairo-ExtraLight.ttf
  static/Cairo-Light.ttf
  static/Cairo-Regular.ttf
  static/Cairo-Medium.ttf
  static/Cairo-SemiBold.ttf
  static/Cairo-Bold.ttf
  static/Cairo-ExtraBold.ttf
  static/Cairo-Black.ttf

Get started
-----------

1. Install the font files you want to use

2. Use your app's font picker to view the font family and all the
available styles
