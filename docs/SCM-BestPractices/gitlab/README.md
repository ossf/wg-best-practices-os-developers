# GitLab Configuration Best Practices

## Intro

GitLab is a collaborative source code management platform that plays a critical
role in modern software development, providing a central repository for
storing, managing, and versioning source code as well as collaborating with
a community of developers. However, it also represent a potential security
risk if not properly configured. In this guide, we will explore the best
practices for securing GitLab, covering topics that include user
authentication, access control, permissions, monitoring, logging,
and integrating security tools.

## Audience

This guide has been written for the:

* **Maintainer** who wants to improve the security posture for one or more
GitLab projects they support.
* **Owner** who wants to improve the security posture for one or more GitLab
groups they manage.
* **Open Source Program Office (OSPO)** who is typically responsible for
multiple groups and projects.
* **Operations** team tasked with applying policies as part of their work
managing assets on GitLab.
* **GitLab enterprise admin** who wants to improve the security posture for their server.

### Operations

General Recommendations:

* Group Membership Should Be Limited to Organization Staff When Relevant.
* Review Security Policies and Procedures At Least Annually.
* Establish a Clear Communication and Incident Response Plan.
* Conduct Regular Security Audits and Vulnerability Assessments.
* Use Tools Built On APIs to Automate Tasks and Avoid Needing Elevated Privileges.
* Review the Configuration Settings Before Making a Repository Public.
* Review the Configuration Settings After Transferring a Repository into the Organization.
* Provide Automated Alerts and Tooling to Ensure Ongoing Compliance.
* Review Audit Events to Track Activity and Changes in Projects and Groups.

Specific Recommendations:

* [Two-Factor Authentication Should Be Enforced For The Group](group/two_factor_authentication_not_required_for_group.md)
* Group Should Use Single-Sign-On
* Only Admins Should Be Able To Create Public Projects and Groups.
* [Webhooks Should Be Configured To Use SSL](group/organization_webhook_doesnt_require_ssl.md)
