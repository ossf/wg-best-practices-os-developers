# GitLab Configuration Best Practices

## Intro

GitLab is a collaborative source code management platform that plays a critical role in modern software development, providing a central repository for storing, managing, and versioning source code as well as collaborating with a community of developers. However, it also represent a potential security risk if not properly configured. In this guide, we will explore the best practices for securing GitLab, covering topics that include user authentication, access control, permissions, monitoring, logging, and integrating security tools.

## Audience

This guide has been written for the:

* **Maintainer** who wants to improve the security posture for one or more GitLab projects they support.  
* **Open Source Program Office (OSPO)** who is typically responsible for multiple groups and projects.
* **Operations** team tasked with applying policies as part of their work managing assets on GitLab.
