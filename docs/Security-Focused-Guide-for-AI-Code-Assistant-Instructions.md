# Security-Focused Guide for AI Code Assistant Instructions

by the OpenSSF Best Practices and the AI/ML Working Groups, 2025-08-01

AI code assistants can significantly speed up development. However, they need guidance to produce **secure** and robust code. This guide explains how to create custom instructions (e.g. [GitHub Copilot instructions file](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/custom-instructions/adding-repository-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot), [Cline instructions file](https://docs.cline.bot/enterprise-solutions/custom-instructions), [Cursor rules](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules), [Claude markdown](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/common-workflows#create-an-effective-claude-md-file), etc.). These instructions ensure the AI assistant accounts for application code security, supply chain safety, and platform or language-specific considerations. They also help embed a "security conscience" into the tool. In practice, this means fewer vulnerabilities making it into your codebase. Remember that these instructions should be kept concise, specific, and actionable. The goal is to influence the AI's behaviour without overwhelming it. [[wiz2025a]](#wiz2025a)

These recommendations are based on expert opinion and various recommendations in the literature. We encourage experimentation and feedback to improve these recommendations. We, as an industry, are together learning how to best use these tools.

## TL;DR

Short on time? Here's what really matters:

* **You Are the Pilot – AI is the Co-pilot:** The developer (you) remains in full control of the code. Critically evaluate and edit AI-generated code just as you would code written by a human colleague and never blindly accept suggestions. [[anssibsi2024a]](#anssibsi2024a)
* **Apply Engineering Best Practices Always:** AI-generated code isn't a shortcut around engineering processes such as code reviews, testing, static analysis, documentation, and version control discipline. [[markvero2025a]](#markvero2025a)
* **Be Security-Conscious:** Assume AI-written code can have bugs or vulnerabilities, because it often does. AI coding assistants can introduce security issues like using outdated cryptography or outdated dependencies, ignoring error handling, or leaking secrets. Check for any secrets or sensitive data in the suggested code. Make sure dependency suggestions are safe and not pulling in known vulnerable packages. [[shihchiehdai2025a]](#shihchiehdai2025a), [[anssibsi2024b]](#anssibsi2024b)
* **Guide the AI:** AI is a powerful assistant, but it works best with your guidance. Write clear prompts that specify security requirements. Don't hesitate to modify or reject AI outputs. Direct your AI tool to build its own instructions file based on this guide. [[swaroopdora2025a]](#swaroopdora2025a) [[haoyan2025a]](#haoyan2025a)
* **Ask the AI to review and improve its own work**. Once you have some AI-written code, where possible, ask it to review and improve its own work (repeating these steps as necessary). This technique is sometimes called Recursive Criticism and Improvement (RCI) and can be remarkably effective. For instance, "Review your previous answer and find problems with your answer" followed by "Based on the problems you found, improve your answer" for one or more iterations. Encourage the use of tools such as linters, SAST, dependency checkers, etc. through the improvement cycles. [[catherinetony2024a]](#catherinetony2024a)

By keeping these points in mind, you can harness AI code assistants effectively without sacrificing quality or security.

### TL;DR Sample Instructions

Here are sample instructions that you can copy and paste
(details are below):

> Provide secure code.
User inputs should be checked for expected format and length.
Always validate function arguments and use parameterized queries for database access.
Escape special characters in user-generated content before rendering it in HTML.
When generating output contexts such as HTML or SQL, use safe frameworks or encoding functions to avoid vulnerabilities.
Use secure authentication flows and enforce role-based access checks where appropriate.
When generating code, handle errors gracefully and log them, but do not expose internal details or secrets in error messages
Use logging frameworks that can be configured for security.
Prefer safe defaults in configurations – for example, use HTTPS by default, require strong encryption algorithms, and disable insecure protocols or options.
Follow least privilege in any configuration or code.
When applicable, generate unit tests for security-critical functions (including negative tests to ensure the code fails safely).
If you generate placeholder code (e.g., `TODO` comments), ensure it is marked for security review before deployment.
Avoid logging sensitive information of PII. Ensure that no sensitive or PII is stored in plaintext.
Use popular, community-trusted libraries for common tasks (and avoid adding obscure dependencies if a standard library or well-known package can do the same job). Do not add dependencies that may be malicious or hallucinated.
Always use the official package manager for the given language (npm, pip, Maven, etc.) to install libraries, rather than copying code snippets.
Specify version ranges or exact versions.
When suggesting dependency versions, prefer the latest stable release and mention updating dependencies regularly to patch vulnerabilities.
Generate a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) by using tools that support standard formats like SPDX or CycloneDX.
Where applicable, use in-toto attestations or similar frameworks to create verifiable records of your build and deployment processes.
Prefer high-level libraries for cryptography rather than rolling your own.
---
> When adding important external resources (scripts, containers, etc.), include steps to verify integrity (like checksum verification or signature validation) if applicable.
When writing file or OS-level operations, use safe functions and check for errors (e.g., use secure file modes, avoid temp files without proper randomness, etc.). If running as a service, drop privileges when possible.
Always include appropriate security headers (Content Security Policy, X-Frame-Options, etc.) in web responses, and use frameworks' built-in protections for cookies and sessions.
When generating code for cloud services (AWS/Azure/GCP), follow the provider's security guidelines (e.g., use parameterized queries for cloud databases, encrypt data at rest and in transit, handle keys via cloud KMS).
When using containers,
use minimal base images and avoid running containers with the root user. Use official images from trusted sources, and pin image versions using immutable digests (e.g., SHA256 hashes) instead of mutable tags like latest.
When working with container images, verify both the integrity and authenticity of images using container signing tools like cosign or notation. Include steps to verify signatures from trusted publishers and implement admission controllers in Kubernetes to enforce signature verification policies.
When generating HTML/JS, do not include direct links to untrusted third-party hosts for critical libraries; use our locally hosted or CDN with integrity checks.
For mobile and desktop apps,
do not suggest storing sensitive data in plaintext on the device; use the platform's secure storage APIs.
When generating github actions or CI/CD pipelines, ensure secrets are stored securely (e.g., using GitHub Secrets or environment variables) and not hard-coded in the workflow files.
Include steps to run security scans (SAST/DAST) and dependency checks in the CI/CD pipeline to catch vulnerabilities early.
When generating infrastructure-as-code (IaC) scripts, ensure they follow security best practices (e.g., restrict access to resources, use secure storage for secrets, and validate inputs) and use the latest versions of devops dependencies such as GitHub actions and lock the version to specific SHA.
In C or C++ code, always use bounds-checked functions (e.g., `strncpy` over `strcpy`), avoid dangerous functions like `gets`, and include buffer size constants to prevent overflow. Enable compiler defenses (stack canaries, fortify source, DEP/NX) in any build configurations you suggest.
In Rust code, avoid using `unsafe` blocks unless absolutely necessary and document any `unsafe` usage with justification.
In any memory-safe language, prefer using safe library functions and types; don't circumvent their safety without cause.
In go code, use the data race detector when building the application.
For Python, do not use `exec`/`eval` on user input and prefer safe APIs (e.g., use the `subprocess` module with `shell=False` to avoid shell injection).
For Python, follow PEP 8 and use type hints, as this can catch misuse early.
For JavaScript/TypeScript, when generating Node.js code, use prepared statements for database queries (just like any other language) and encode any data that goes into HTML to prevent XSS.
For Java, when suggesting web code (e.g., using Spring), ensure to use built-in security annotations and avoid old, vulnerable libraries (e.g., use `BCryptPasswordEncoder` rather than writing a custom password hash).
For C#, Use .NET's cryptography and identity libraries instead of custom solutions.
---
> Never suggest turning off security features like XML entity security or type checking during deserialization.
Code suggestions should adhere to OWASP Top 10 principles (e.g., avoid injection, enforce access control) and follow the OWASP ASVS requirements where applicable.
Our project follows SAFECode's secure development practices – the AI should prioritize those (e.g., proper validation, authentication, cryptography usage per SAFECode guidance).
When generating code, consider compliance requirements (e.g., HIPAA privacy rules for medical data, PCI-DSS for credit card info) – do not output code that logs or transmits sensitive data in insecure ways.
Include comments or TODOs in code suggesting security reviews for complex logic, and note if any third-party component might need a future update or audit.
When writing or reviewing code, run or simulate the use of tools like CodeQL, Bandit, Semgrep, or OWASP Dependency-Check. Identify any flagged vulnerabilities or outdated dependencies and revise the code accordingly. Repeat this process until the code passes all simulated scans.

## **Secure Coding Principles in AI Instructions**

One of the first sections in your instructions should reinforce general secure coding best practices. These principles apply to all languages and frameworks, and you want the AI to **always** keep them in mind when generating code:

* **Input Validation & Output Encoding:** Instruct the AI to treat all external inputs as untrusted and to validate them. *Example: "user inputs should be checked for expected format and length"*. Any output should be properly encoded to prevent injection attacks such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS). *Example: "Always validate function arguments and use parameterized queries for database access"* and *"Escape special characters in user-generated content before rendering it in HTML"*. Similarly, specify that when generating output contexts such as HTML or SQL, the assistant should use safe frameworks or encoding functions to avoid vulnerabilities. [[swaroopdora2025b]](#swaroopdora2025b) [[wiz2025b]](#wiz2025b) [[haoyan2025b]](#haoyan2025b)
* **Authentication, Authorization & Secrets Management:** Emphasize that credentials and sensitive tokens must never be hard-coded or exposed. Your instructions can say: *"Never include API keys, passwords, or secrets in code output, and use environment variables or secure vault references instead"*. Also instruct the AI to use secure authentication flows (for instance, using industry-standard libraries for handling passwords or tokens) and to enforce role-based access checks where appropriate. [[hammondpearce2021a]](#hammondpearce2021a) [[neilperry2022a]](#neilperry2022a) [[swaroopdora2025c]](#swaroopdora2025c)
* **Error Handling & Logging:** Guide the AI to implement errors securely by catching exceptions and failures without revealing sensitive info (stack traces, server paths, etc.) to the end-user. In your instructions, you might include: *"When generating code, handle errors gracefully and log them, but do not expose internal details or secrets in error messages".* This ensures the assistant's suggestions include secure error-handling patterns (like generic user-facing messages and detailed logs only on the server side). Additionally, instruct the AI to use logging frameworks that can be configured for security (e.g. avoiding logging of personal data or secrets).  [[swaroopdora2025d]](#swaroopdora2025d)
* **Secure Defaults & Configurations:** Include guidance such as: *"Prefer safe defaults in configurations – for example, use HTTPS by default, require strong encryption algorithms, and disable insecure protocols or options".* By specifying this, the AI will be more likely to generate code that opts-in to security features. Always instruct the AI to follow the principle of least privilege (e.g. minimal file system permissions, least-privileged user accounts for services, etc.) in any configuration or code it proposes. [[wiz2025c]](#wiz2025c) [[swaroopdora2025e]](#swaroopdora2025e)
* **Testing for Security:** Encourage the AI to produce or suggest tests for critical code paths including negative tests that verify that what shouldn't happen, doesn't happen. In your instructions, add: *"When applicable, generate unit tests for security-critical functions (including negative tests to ensure the code fails safely)"*. [[anssibsi2024c]](#anssibsi2024c) [[markvero2025b]](#markvero2025b)
* **Data Protection:** When generating code, always prioritize data minimization and avoid storing or processing confidential or otherwise sensitive information (like personal data - PII) unless absolutely necessary. For that case, suggest strong encryption at rest and in transit, and recommend techniques like anonymization. For example: *"Generate a function that securely handles user input for a registration form, asking for necessary fields to avoid logging sensitive PII. Ensure that no sensitive or PII is stored in plaintext"*. [[swaroopdora2025f]](#swaroopdora2025f)

Note that we are *not* currently recommending in the general case that the AI be told to respond from a particular viewpoint (e.g., a role or persona) or character a.k.a. "persona pattern/memetic proxy". An example of this approach would be the instruction "Act as a software security expert. Provide outputs that a security expert would give". One set of experiments found that this approach performs poorly, producing the worst number of security weaknesses compared to other approaches. [[catherinetony2024b]](#catherinetony2024b) However, we encourage continued experimentation, and may change our recommendations based on future information.

## **Addressing Software Supply Chain Security**

Modern software heavily relies on third-party libraries and dependencies. It's crucial that your AI assistant's instructions cover supply chain security, ensuring that suggested dependencies and build processes are secure:

* **Safe Dependency Selection:** Instruct the AI to prefer well-vetted, reputable libraries when suggesting code that pulls in external packages. This is especially important to counter hallucinated package names; one study found 19.7% proposed packages did not exist [[josephspracklen2024e]](#josephspracklen2024e). These hallucinations enable "slopsquatting" attacks, where attackers create malicious packages with names commonly hallucinated by AI models  [[billtoulas2025a]](#billtoulas2025a). While it's important to independently check new dependencies, AI tools can often self-identify these names if asked to do so [[josephspracklen2024f]](#josephspracklen2024f). For example: *"Use popular, community-trusted libraries for common tasks (and avoid adding obscure dependencies if a standard library or well-known package can do the same job). Do not add dependencies that may be malicious or hallucinated.".* Emphasize evaluating packages before use – as a developer would manually. [[josephspracklen2024a]](#josephspracklen2024a)
* **Use Package Managers & Lock Versions:** Your instructions should tell the AI to use proper package management. For instance: *"Always use the official package manager for the given language (npm, pip, Maven, etc.) to install libraries, rather than copying code snippets".* Also, instruct it to specify version ranges or exact versions that are known to be secure. By doing so, the AI will generate code that, for example, uses a `requirements.txt` or `package.json` entry, which aids in maintaining supply chain integrity. [[openssf2023a]](#openssf2023a)
* **Stay Updated & Monitor Vulnerabilities:** Include guidance for keeping dependencies up-to-date. For example: *"When suggesting dependency versions, prefer the latest stable release and mention updating dependencies regularly to patch vulnerabilities"*. [[arifulhaque2025a]](#arifulhaque2025a) [[josephspracklen2024b]](#josephspracklen2024b)
* **Generate Software Bill of Materials (SBOM):** Instruct the AI to create and maintaining SBOMs for better visibility into your software supply chain. For example: *"Generate an SBOM by using tools that support standard formats like SPDX or CycloneDX".* You can also mention provenance tracking: *"Where applicable, use an attestations framework such as in-toto or similar to create verifiable records of your build and deployment processes".* This ensures comprehensive tracking of what goes into your software and provides the foundation for ongoing vulnerability monitoring and incident response. [[anssibsi2024e]](#anssibsi2024e)
* **Integrity Verification:** To further secure the supply chain, you can instruct the assistant to show how to verify what it uses. For instance: *"When adding important external resources (scripts, containers, etc.), include steps to verify integrity (like checksum verification or signature validation) if applicable".* [[josephspracklen2024c]](#josephspracklen2024c)

---

## **Platform and Runtime Security Considerations**

Every software runs somewhere – be it a web browser, a cloud platform, an IoT device, or an OS. Your guide for the AI assistant should have a section addressing platform-specific and runtime security concerns:

* **Operating System and Environment:** If your code will run on a server or user machine, instruct the AI on safe system interactions. *"When writing file or OS-level operations, use safe functions and check for errors (e.g., use secure file modes, avoid temp files without proper randomness, etc.). If running as a service, drop privileges when possible".* This ensures the AI's output respects security at the OS level (for example, not recommending running as root unless absolutely necessary). Emphasize least privilege: for instance, code for a service should use the minimal privileges needed. The assistant could then suggest using system APIs that limit permissions or show how to configure a Linux capability instead of full root access. [[arifulhaque2025b]](#arifulhaque2025b) [[shihchiehdai2025b]](#shihchiehdai2025b)
* **Web and Cloud Platforms:** For web applications, direct the AI to include web security best practices. *"Always include appropriate security headers (Content Security Policy, X-Frame-Options, etc.) in web responses, and use frameworks' built-in protections for cookies and sessions".* You can also mention using HTTPS for any client-server communication. On cloud platforms, instruct it on secure use of cloud services: *"When generating code for cloud services (AWS/Azure/GCP), follow the provider's security guidelines (e.g., use parameterized queries for cloud databases, encrypt data at rest and in transit, handle keys via cloud KMS)".* [[swaroopdora2025g]](#swaroopdora2025g) [[neilperry2022b]](#neilperry2022b)
* **Container and Deployment Considerations:** If your project uses containers or orchestrators (like Docker, Kubernetes), include guidance like: *"Use minimal base images and avoid running containers with the root user. Use official images from trusted sources, and pin image versions using immutable digests (e.g., SHA256 hashes) instead of mutable tags like latest".* This will cause the AI to generate Dockerfiles or deployment scripts that adhere to container security best practices and ties into supply chain concerns as well – using only trusted images and specific versions that ensure consistency and prevent supply chain attacks. Additionally, instruct the AI on container signature verification: *"When working with container images, verify both the integrity and authenticity of images using container signing tools like cosign or notation. Include steps to verify signatures from trusted publishers and implement admission controllers in Kubernetes to enforce signature verification policies".* Instruct the AI to further control deployment artifacts. For instance, by ensuring production websites only load resources from trusted domains to avoid subversion: *"When generating HTML/JS, do not include direct links to untrusted third-party hosts for critical libraries; use our locally hosted or CDN with integrity checks".* [[anssibsi2024f]](#anssibsi2024f) [[josephspracklen2024d]](#josephspracklen2024d)
* **Mobile and Desktop App Security:** If relevant, instruct on platform-specific secure coding. For mobile apps, you might say: *"Do not suggest storing sensitive data in plaintext on the device; use the platform's secure storage APIs".* For desktop apps, *"Prefer high-level libraries for cryptography rather than rolling your own".* These platform notes ensure the AI isn't blind to the context in which code runs. It will include, for example, usage of Android's `SharedPreferences` with encryption or Apple's Keychain for iOS if dealing with credentials, reflecting platform best practices. [[hammondpearce2021b]](#hammondpearce2021b)
* **Operational Security:** Instruct the AI to consider devops security aspects. For example: *"When generating github actions or CI/CD pipelines, ensure secrets are stored securely (e.g., using GitHub Secrets or environment variables) and not hard-coded in the workflow files"*. This will help the AI generate secure CI/CD configurations that prevent accidental exposure of sensitive information. You can also instruct it to include security checks in the pipeline: *"Include steps to run security scans (SAST/DAST) and dependency checks in the CI/CD pipeline to catch vulnerabilities early"*. This ensures that the AI's generated code integrates security into the development lifecycle, rather than treating it as an afterthought. Treat devops tools with the same security rigor as application code. For example, instruct the AI to use secure coding practices in infrastructure-as-code (IaC) scripts, such as Terraform or CloudFormation: *"When generating IaC scripts, ensure they follow security best practices (e.g., restrict access to resources, use secure storage for secrets, and validate inputs)"* and *"use the latest versions of devops dependencies such as GitHub actions and lock the version to specific SHA"*. [[anssibsi2024g]](#anssibsi2024g) [[openssf2023b]](#openssf2023b)

## **Programming Language-Specific Security Examples**

It's valuable to dedicate individual paragraphs to language-specific security considerations that are relevant to your project. The following section serves as examples, or special cases the AI should handle to highlight unique vulnerabilities or features of that language and how the AI should approach them:

* **C/C++ (Memory-Unsafe Languages):** For languages without automatic memory safety, instruct the AI to be extra cautious with memory management. *"In C or C++ code, always use bounds-checked functions (e.g., `strncpy` over `strcpy`), avoid dangerous functions like `gets`, and include buffer size constants to prevent overflow. Enable compiler defenses (stack canaries, fortify source, DEP/NX) in any build configurations you suggest"*. By giving such instructions, the assistant might prefer safer standard library calls or even suggest modern C++ classes (`std::vector` instead of raw arrays) to reduce manual memory handling. It will also acknowledge when an operation is risky, possibly inserting comments like "// ensure no buffer overflow". [[connordilgren2025a]](#connordilgren2025a) [[neilperry2022c]](#neilperry2022c)
* **Rust, Go, and Memory-Safe Languages:** If the project involves memory-safe languages (Rust, Go, Java, C#, etc.), you can note that the AI should leverage their safety features. *"In Rust code, avoid using `unsafe` blocks unless absolutely necessary and document any `unsafe` usage with justification".* Memory-safe-by-default languages enforce a lot at compile time, but you should still have the AI follow best practices of those ecosystems. For example, instruct: *"In any memory-safe language, prefer using safe library functions and types; don't circumvent their safety without cause".* If a language offers any tools to verify memory access, direct the AI assistant to use them while building or testing your code. For Example "*In go code, use the data race detector when building the application*". [[openssf2023c]](#openssf2023c)
* **Python and Dynamic Languages:** Python, JavaScript, and other high-level languages manage memory for you, but come with their own security pitfalls. In your instructions, emphasize things like avoiding exec/eval with untrusted input in Python and being careful with command execution. *"For Python, do not use `exec`/`eval` on user input and prefer safe APIs (e.g., use the `subprocess` module with `shell=False` to avoid shell injection)".* Additionally, mention type checking or the use of linters: *"Follow PEP 8 and use type hints, as this can catch misuse early".* For JavaScript/TypeScript, you might add: *"When generating Node.js code, use prepared statements for database queries (just like any other language) and encode any data that goes into HTML to prevent XSS".* These instructions incorporate known best practices (like those from OWASP cheat sheets) directly into the AI's behavior. [[haoyan2025c]](#haoyan2025c)
* **Java/C# and Enterprise Languages:** In languages often used for large applications, you might focus on frameworks and configurations. *"For Java, when suggesting web code (e.g., using Spring), ensure to use built-in security annotations and avoid old, vulnerable libraries (e.g., use `BCryptPasswordEncoder` rather than writing a custom password hash)".* For C#, similarly: *"Use .NET's cryptography and identity libraries instead of custom solutions".* Also instruct about managing object deserialization (both Java and C# have had vulnerabilities in this area): *"Never suggest turning off security features like XML entity security or type checking during deserialization".* These language-specific notes guide the AI to incorporate the well-known secure patterns of each ecosystem. [[neilperry2022d]](#neilperry2022d)

---

## **Referencing Security Standards and Frameworks**

To strengthen your AI assistant's guidance, you should point it toward established security standards and frameworks. By referencing these in the instructions, the AI will be biased toward solutions that comply with widely accepted practices:

* **Use Industry Standards as Keywords:** Mention standards like **OWASP Top 10**, **OWASP ASVS**, **CWE/SANS Top 25**, or language-specific guidelines (Java's SEI CERT secure coding standards, for instance). For example: *"Code suggestions should adhere to OWASP Top 10 principles (e.g., avoid injection, enforce access control) and follow the OWASP ASVS requirements where applicable"*. [[arifulhaque2025c]](#arifulhaque2025c)
* **Reference SAFECode and Other Guides:** SAFECode (Software Assurance Forum for Excellence in Code) publishes **Fundamental Practices for Secure Software Development**, and including a note about it can be beneficial. *"Our project follows SAFECode's secure development practices – the AI should prioritize those (e.g., proper validation, authentication, cryptography usage per SAFECode guidance)"*. This ties the assistant's suggestions to a comprehensive set of secure development principles. Similarly, you can reference the **Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC)** or standards like **ISO 27034** if your organization uses them, to align AI outputs with those processes. [[neilperry2022e]](#neilperry2022e)
* **Compliance and Regulatory Security:** If you operate in an industry with specific regulations (like healthcare or finance), instruct the AI with those in mind. For instance: *"When generating code, consider compliance requirements (e.g., HIPAA privacy rules for medical data, PCI-DSS for credit card info) – do not output code that logs or transmits sensitive data in insecure ways"*. This ensures the AI's suggestions are compliant with external standards, for example, it might suggest encryption for personal data fields by default. [[arifulhaque2025d]](#arifulhaque2025d)
* **Continuous Improvement Hooks:** Encourage practices that integrate with ongoing security processes. For example: *"Include comments or TODOs in code suggesting security reviews for complex logic, and note if any third-party component might need a future update or audit"*. This way, the AI not only writes code but also flags areas for human scrutiny or future action. If the AI outputs a piece of cryptography code, for instance, it might add a comment "// TODO: security review for cryptographic implementation" because you instructed it that critical code should not go un-reviewed. [[anssibsi2024h]](#anssibsi2024h) [[fossa2023]](#fossa2023) [[anssibsi2024d]](#anssibsi2024d)
* **Integrate and Act on Automated Security Tooling:** Instruct the AI to proactively run automated security tools (e.g., SAST, DAST, SCA) during code generation and refinement. Example: "When writing or reviewing code, run or simulate the use of tools like CodeQL, Bandit, Semgrep, or OWASP Dependency-Check. Identify any flagged vulnerabilities or outdated dependencies and revise the code accordingly. Repeat this process until the code passes all simulated scans". This positions the AI not just as a code generator but as a security-aware assistant capable of iterating based on tool feedback.
