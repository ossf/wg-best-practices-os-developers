    Strictly speaking, using a backquoted template with a single

<h1>Lab Exercise argument-injection</h1>
<p>
This is a lab exercise on developing secure software.
For more information, see the <a href="introduction.html" target="_blank">introduction to
the labs</a>.

<p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>
<b>Eliminate an argument injection vulnerability in a Node.js application</b>

<p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
Node.js developers often need to execute system commands or external 
tools from their applications. This may be to leverage existing 
functionality, interface with system utilities, or process data.
However, if not implemented carefully, this can lead to serious
security vulnerabilities.
</p>

<p>
Argument injection is a sub-class of command injection vulnerabilities.
It occurs when user-supplied input is passed unchecked into commands 
executed by an application, with the difference that the user-supplied
input is used as arguments to the command rather than the command 
itself or rather than creating a new command. In this scenario,
attackers may craft malicious command-line arguments that exploit
flags to a command (such as `--output=` or `--shell=...`) with the 
aim of manipulating the command's behavior or executing unintended
commands altogether.
</p>

<p>
To prevent argument injection, applications need to carefully
validate and sanitize any user input before it's used in command
execution. This includes using allowlists to restrict allowed 
characters, separating arguments properly, and avoiding shell 
execution when possible.
</p>

<p>
<h2>Task Information</h2>
<p>
In this task, we will fix an argument injection vulnerability 
in a Node.js application that uses the `git blame` command.
</p>

<p>
This code is vulnerable to argument injection.
An attacker could provide input like <tt>--output=/tmp/malicious</tt>
to write arbitrary files on the server or execute unintended git commands.
</p>

<p>
Your task is to modify this function to prevent argument injection
while still allowing valid file paths. You should
validate and sanitize the <tt>filePath</tt> input;
for purposes of this exercise we'll assume that's already been done
before this function is called.
You should:
    <ul>
        <li>Use a secure process execution function instead of <tt>exec</tt> to avoid shell interpretation.</li>
        <li>Separate the command and its arguments.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

Here are some hints:
<ul>
  <li>The <tt>execFile</tt> function takes four parameters: the command, a list containing the arguments, options, and callback information. By convention the callback information is usually <tt>(error, stdout, stderr)</tt> in this circumstance.
  <li>We encourage expressly providing an option that disables calling the shell unnecessarily, using <tt>shell: false</tt> as its third option. That's the default, so it's not strictly necessary, but it might help later developers and reviewers realize it's intentional.
</li>
  <li>Use the special shell double dash <tt>--</tt> to separate command-line arguments from positional arguments when the shell interprets a command string</li>
</ul>

<p>
Remember, the goal is to make it much harder for an attacker to inject malicious arguments while still allowing the function to work with valid file paths.

<h2>Interactive Lab (<span id="grade"></span>)</h2>
<p>
Rewrite the following function to be safe:
<p>
<form id="lab">
<pre><code>
const { exec } = require('child_process');

function blameFile(filePath) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  
  # Allow invoking the `git blame` command in a safe and
  # secure way from user input providing a file path

<textarea id="attempt0" rows="3" cols="60" spellcheck="false">
    exec(`git blame ${filePath}`,
         (error, stdout, stderr) => {</textarea>

      if (error) {
        reject(error);
        return;
      }
      resolve(stdout);
    });
  });
}
