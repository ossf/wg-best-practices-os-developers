# Create labs

We would *love* for people to create many labs!

Our system for creating labs runs entirely on the user's web browser
(client side). We do this so that users can *immediately* start
their exercises - they don't need to install anything, they don't need
to create an account somewhere, and we don't have to run arbitrary code
provided from users on some server.

## checker.js

The current system we implement is called `checker.js`,
There may be other systems you can also use in the future.

For more about how to create labs with checker, see
[create_checker](./create_checker).
