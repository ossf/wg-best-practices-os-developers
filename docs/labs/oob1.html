<h1>Lab Exercise oob1</h1>
<p>
This is a lab exercise on developing secure software.
For more information, see the <a href="introduction.html" target="_blank">introduction to
the labs</a>.

<p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>
<b>Please change the code below to fix this simplified version
of the "Heartbleed" bug in OpenSSL, an example of a buffer overread.</b>

<p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
In almost all programming languages, the default response a program
attempts to read or write outside
of a buffer is either an attempt to resize the buffer or
an error of some kind (e.g., raising an exception).
That's because it's extremely easy to accidentally attempt to read
or write outside of a buffer.
<p>
However, C and the built-in arrays of C++ are different.
In C and C++, attempting to read or write outside a buffer is
<i>undefined behavior</i> and <i>anything</i> is allowed to happen
without any kind of protection.
In practice, what often happens is a read or write (respectively) of
other data.
<p>
The 2014 revelation of the Heartbleed vulnerability
(CVE-2014-0160) is an example of a buffer overread vulnerability.
Heartbleed was a vulnerability in OpenSSL, a widely-used toolkit
that implements the cryptographic protocol Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL) and its successor the Transport Layer Security (TLS).
Heartbleed affected a huge number of popular websites, including
Google, YouTube, Yahoo!, Pinterest, Blogspot, Instagram, Tumblr,
Reddit, Netflix, Stack Overflow, Slate, GitHub, Yelp, Etsy, the
U.S. Postal Service (USPS), Blogger, Dropbox, Wikipedia, and the
Washington Post.
See <a href="https://dwheeler.com/essays/heartbleed.html">here</a> for more.

<p>
<h2>Task Information</h2>
<p>
We're going re-create the fix in OpenSSF for the Heartbleed vulnerability
by modifying function <tt>dtls1_process_heartbeat</tt>.
<p>
At this point in the code, the construct
<tt>s->s3->rrec.length</tt>
indicates how many bytes are available.
Modify the code below in two places.
<p>
First, modify the code so that
if the minimum length of a response <tt>(1 + 2 + 16)</tt> is more than
the length claimed by
<tt>s->s3->rrec.length</tt>,
return return 0 without sending a heartbeat,
This will prevent trying to create a heartbeat when there's not enough
room to create one.
<p>
Second, modify the code so that
if the minimum length of a response with a payload
<tt>(1 + 2 + payload + 16</tt>
is more than the total length for a response given in
<tt>s->s3->rrec.length</tt> then again
return return 0 without sending a heartbeat,
<p>
This will prevent trying to create a heartbeat when there's not enough
room to create one.
<p>
Note that this is not terribly difficult to fix.
The problem is that reading and writing buffers is extremely common,
but by default such accesses are unsafe in C and C++.
In practice it is difficult to <i>always</i> check all ranges
in all possible cases.
<!--
        if (1 + 2 + 16 > s->s3->rrec.length)
                return 0; /* silently discard */
