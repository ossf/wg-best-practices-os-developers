<h1>Lab Exercise Input1</h1>
<p>
This is a lab exercise on developing secure software.
For more information, see the <a href="introduction.html">introduction to
the labs</a>.

<p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
In this exercise, we'll perform a simple input validation for
a server-side program written in JavaScript using a simulation
of the Express version 4 framework and the express-validator library.
The point isn't to learn about these specific technologies;
the point is to learn how to write secure software in general.

<p>
<!-- https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html -->
Express allows us to state that when the system receives
a HTTP request method (e.g., <tt>get</tt> which gets data) for a given route
(e.g., <tt>/invoices</tt>), it should run a list of functions ("handlers").
The library `express-validator` provides a set of validation functions
and an easy integration into Express, so you can validation checks
as additional handlers.

<p>
The code below sets up what to do for a <tt>get</tt> on path
<tt>/invoices</tt>.
If there are no validation errors, it shows the invoice id.
If there is a validation error, it responds with HTTP
error code 422 ("Unprocessable Content"), a status code suggesting
that the request was invalid for some reason, along with an error message.

<p>
Unfortunately, this program doesn't <i>do</i> enough input validation.
In this application
<tt>id</tt> is supposed to only be an integer within a restricted range.
In fact, as written
this program has a vulnerability we haven't covered yet called
Cross-site Scripting (XSS), which we would be entirely prevented if we did
better input validation.

<p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>
Please change the code below so the query parameter
<tt>id</tt> must be an integer between 1 and 9999.

<p>
To do that,
after the first parameter to <tt>app.get</tt>
which says <tt>'/invoices'</tt>,
add a new comma-separated parameter beginning with
the text <tt>query('id')</tt> to select the
<tt>id</tt>i parameter for validation.
Add a period (<tt>.</tt>) and the validation requirement
<tt>IsInt()</tt> (which requires that the named parameter be
an integer).
The <tt>IsInt</tt> method takes, as an optional parameter,
an object providing a minimum and maximum, e.g.,
<tt>isInt({min: YOUR_MINIMUM, max: YOUR_MAXIMUM})</tt>.

<p>
You can press the <i>Reset</i> button to start over.

<p>
Once you think you have an answer, press the <i>Submit</i> button.
This will then run a number of test cases to tell you if you appear to have
the correct answer.
Note that this is a simulation of Express and express-validator
(not the real things).

// Implement requests such as http://localhost:3000/invoices?id=1

  const result = validationResult(req); // Retrieve errors
  if (result.isEmpty()) { // No errors
    const data = matchedData(req);
    return res.send(`You requested invoice id ${data.id}!`);
