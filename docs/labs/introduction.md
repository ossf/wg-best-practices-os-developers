# Introduction to the Labs

These are simple lab exercises
to help you learn how to develop secure software.
They were designed to support the
“Developing Secure Software” (LFD121) and
"Secure Software Development Fundamentals" (edX) program.

These labs will run on your local web browser,
so you don't need to install anything
and you don't need to log into a remote system.

You'll be writing snippets of code in a web page.

In these labs you'll write code in JavaScript.
However, if you're not familiar with JavaScript, don't worry;
we'll help you along by providing starter code.
Our focus is on the fundamentals of developing secure software
(not JavaScript specifically).
If you want to learn more about JavaScript, there are many resources available,
such as [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net).

In many cases you'll be writing code that uses Express,
a widely-used server-side framework for JavaScript, along with
`express-validator`, a widely-used validation framework for Express.
There are frameworks other than Express, and other validation frameworks
for Express, but had to pick *something*.
We'll often fill in other parts, so you can focus on the
specific issues we're discussing.

Many labs compare your attempt against a pattern for an expected
correct answer. In many cases you can find an obscure way to write
code that would produce the correct result yet not be considered correct.
For example, instead of writing `1` you could write `(2-1)` or
`0x1`. We believe it's defensible that these other answers are incorrect.
We are looking for code that is *simple* and *clear*, not just
code that would produce the correct answer.
If you believe that an answer should be accepted as correct, please
raise an issue on GitHub identifying the problem, the answer you
think *should* also be accepted, and why you think it should be accepted.

NOTE: At this time these labs are in the OpenSSF Best Practices
Working Group /docs directory, making them visible to the public.
The Working Group and its Education SIG have *not* approved
these materials yet; they're under review.
We've merged these materials so that they can be properly
tested and reviewed.
Please don't create a link to these materials suggesting that they
are approved until they *are* approved.
