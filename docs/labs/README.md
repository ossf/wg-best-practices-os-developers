# Labs

These are labs for those who are learning how to develop secure software.
See our [introduction](introduction) for more information.

You can download the labs in these sections, e.g., to run locally
without Internet access.

We *want* people to create more labs! Here's more information about
how to do that and the labs we'd like created.

## Available labs

Here are the labs available:

* [hello](hello.html) - simple "Hello, world!" demo
* [input1](input1.html) - input validation (simple types)
* [regex0](regex0.html) - regular expressions (regexes) - introduction
* [regex1](regex1.html) - regular expressions (regexes)
* [input2](input2.html) - input validation (more complex situations)
* [csp1](csp1.html) - Content Security Policy (CSP)

## Please contribute labs

We would love to have people contribute relevant labs to help
people learn how to develop secure software.
We'd be happy to give you credit through a "wall of fame".

If you're interested, please contact
[David A. Wheeler](mailto:dwheele&#114;&#64;linuxfoundation&#46;org).
See below for how to create labs and our lab roadmap.

## How to create and submit labs

See [create labs](create_labs) if you want to learn how to create labs.
In particular, that page will link to how to
[create labs using checker](create_checker).

To submit new or updated labs, create a pull request on the
[OpenSSF Best Practices WG](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/)
under the `docs/labs` directory.

## Lab Roadmap

We plan to create labs for the secure software development
fundamentals course;
[here is its development website](https://github.com/ossf/secure-sw-dev-fundamentals).

Below are the sections where we plan to create labs, along with
mappings to existing labs or people who have agreed to work on one.
The items marked "PLANNED-1" are those we intend to do first;
"PLANNED-2" are planned in a second pass.
