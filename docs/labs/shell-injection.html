<h1>Lab Exercise shell-injection</h1>
<p>
This is a lab exercise on developing secure software.
For more information, see the <a href="introduction.html" target="_blank">introduction to
the labs</a>.

<p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>
<b>Eliminate a shell injection vulnerability.</b>

<p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
In many cases, programmers run system commands from their applications.
This happens for multiple reasons: running a complicated tool, avoiding to
code a functionality that exists in another tool,
or just because the application
(often a web application) is an interface to a tool running
on the server system.
Doing this incorrectly, however, can lead to vulnerabilities.
</p>

<p>
Quite often the list of parameters of that external tool isn't static.
One or multiple parameters are given by an untrusted end user.
This may be the name
they give to the project, for example.
The application needs to avoid passing these parameters through the shell
at all if the shell isn't needed.
</p>

<p>
In addition,
the application need to carefully handle
the given parameters to make sure they do not contain special characters like
the end of the command (often ';'). Otherwise, an attacker might be
able to craft input
in such a way that they execute commands of their choice in addition to the
one present in the application.
We need to do that with an allowlist, that is, by expressly listing what
is allowed (and forbidding everything else).
</p>

<p>
<h2>Task Information</h2>
<p>
In this task we are going to fix a shell command injection situation. You may
want to test the result of different user input separately to see what happens.
</p>

<p>
Our scenario is a simple one. In our application in Python, we want to list
files in a temporary directory used by our application for data processing.
The original code was:
</p>

<pre><code>
subprocess.run("ls -l", shell=True)
</code></pre>

<p>
Then, another developer added user input for the directory with the raw user
data in the variable <pre>dir_to_list</pre> as follows:
</p>

<pre><code>def list_directory(dir_to_list):
    subprocess.run(f"ls -l {dir_to_list}", shell=True)
</pre></code>

<p>
This is a shell injection vulnerability.
An attacker can put arbitrary text into the parameter, which will be
executed by the shell.
It would safer to <i>not</i> invoke the shell at all, <i>and</i> ensure
that only safe characters would be considered.
</p>
<p>
To be fair, a typical Python program wouldn't call "ls" directly;
we'll do that to keep the example simple.
</p>

<h2>Interactive Lab (<span id="grade"></span>)</h2>
<p>
Rewrite the following function to be safe:
<p>
<form id="lab">
<pre><code>def list_directory(dir_to_list):
  # Modify the directory so it only contains a-zA-Z0-9
<textarea id="attempt0" rows="2" cols="60" spellcheck="false">
  clean_dir = dir_to_list
</textarea>
  # Then use subprocess in a safer way
<textarea id="attempt1" rows="2" cols="60" spellcheck="false">
  subprocess.run(f"ls -l {dir_to_list}", shell=True)
</textarea>
</code></pre>
