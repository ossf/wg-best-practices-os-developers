  In Python, newline and carriage return are whitespace but are *meaningful*
  outside of (...). So we match specifically on space (\x20) instead.
  This makes our patterns harder to read, unfortunately.
  It's conventional to use raw strings in Python for regexes, so we allow
  and encourage them, but we'll accept *not* using raw strings since they
  don't add value in this situation.

    You need to compute a new string using re.sub and assign the result

    `clean_dir = re.sub(PATTERN, REPLACETEXT, dir_to_list)`.

- present: PATTERN
  text: >
    We use `PATTERN` as a placeholder (metavariable) for the
    expression you should use.  The answer won't actually say PATTERN
    anywhere. Your first line should look like
    `clean_dir = re.sub(PATTERN, REPLACETEXT, dir_to_list)`
    but `PATTERN` is a string with the regex of the pattern of text you
    want to replace, and `REPLACETEXT` is what you want to replace it with.
    The PATTERN would probably look like `r'...'` where the `...`
    is the regular expression matching what you want to eliminate.
  examples:
  -
    - "  clean_dir = re.sub(PATTERN, PATTERN, dir_to_list)"
    - '  subprocess.run(f"ls -l {dir_to_list}", shell=True)'
- absent: |-
    re \. sub \( r
  text: >
    Python re.sub uses strings to indicate a regex pattern.
    By convention these strings are usually 'raw' strings, so they
    have the form `r'PATTERN'`. We would recommend that you use raw strings,
    in the pattern
    `re.sub(r'...', ...)` even though raw strings don't make this
    *specific* example easier.

    re \. sub \( r['"]
  text: >
    Python re.sub uses strings to indicate a regex pattern.
    By convention these strings usually 'raw' strings, so they
    have the form `r'PATTERN'`. You have the "r" but not the following
    single or double quote character.
- absent: |-
    re \. sub \( r?['"]\[
  text: >
    Use re.sub(r'[...]', ...) to
    indicate that you want to replace every character matching a
    certain pattern. Note the square brackets in the regular expression.
    Replace the `...` with the pattern of characters to be replaced.
  examples:
  -
    - "  clean_dir = re.sub(r'', '', dir_to_list)"
    - '  subprocess.run(f"ls -l {dir_to_list}", shell=True)'
- absent: |-
    re \. sub \( r?['"]\[\^
  text: >
    Use re.sub(r'[^ALPHANUMERIC_PATTERN]', '', dir_to_list) to
    indicate that you want to replace everything that is not
    an alphanumeric character. Notice the use of the caret symbol `^`;
    we are replacing everything *not* matching a certain pattern.
    It's okay to use a caret here, because we aren't validating input,
    we are filtering (removing) all the input *not* permitted.
    Be sure to replace ALPHANUMERIC_PATTERN
    with a regular expression pattern that describes alphanumerics!
  examples:
  -
    - "  clean_dir = re.sub(r'[a-zA-Z0-9]', '', dir_to_list)"
    - '  subprocess.run(f"ls -l {dir_to_list}", shell=True)'

    Use `a-zA-Z0-9` in your substitution pattern.

    - '  subprocess.run(f"ls -l {dir_to_list}")'
- absent: |-
    re \. sub \( r?('\[\^a-zA-Z0-9\]'|"\[\^a-zA-Z0-9\]") , r?(''|"")
  text: >
    The second parameter of `re.sub` should be an empty string, that is,
    `''` or `""`. You are matching everything you don't want, and
    replacing it with nothing at all.
  examples:
  -
    - "  clean_dir = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9]', NOWWHAT, dir_to_list)"

    You should generally avoid using string concatenation when creating
    a command to execute. Formatted strings like f"..." are a form of
    string concatenation. In addition, you MUST avoid string concatenation
    in this case. The shell uses spaces to separate arguments, but we're
    trying to avoid using the shell when it's not needed.
    You must instead provide the arguments as a list that contains
    separate parameters. The parameters should be something like
    "ls", "-l", clean_dir
  examples:
  -
    - "  clean_dir = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9]', '', dir_to_list)"
    - '  subprocess.run(f"ls -l {dir_to_list}")'

    The `subprocess.run` function takes a LIST of parameters as its command,

    inside the parentheses.

<h1>Lab Exercise shell-injection</h1>
<p>
This is a lab exercise on developing secure software.
For more information, see the <a href="introduction.html" target="_blank">introduction to
the labs</a>.

<p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>
<b>Eliminate a shell injection vulnerability.</b>

<p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
In many cases, programmers run system commands from their applications.
This happens for multiple reasons: running a complicated tool, avoiding to
code a functionality that exists in another tool,
or just because the application
(often a web application) is an interface to a tool running
on the server system.
Doing this incorrectly, however, can lead to vulnerabilities.
</p>

<p>
Quite often the list of parameters of that external tool isn't static.
One or multiple parameters are given by an untrusted end user.
This may be the name
they give to the project, for example.
The application needs to avoid passing these parameters through the shell
at all if the shell isn't needed.
</p>

<p>
In addition,
the application need to carefully handle
the given parameters to make sure they do not contain special characters like
the end of the command (often ';'). Otherwise, an attacker might be
able to craft input
in such a way that they execute commands of their choice in addition to the
one present in the application.
We need to do that with an allowlist, that is, by expressly listing what
is allowed (and forbidding everything else).
</p>

<p>
<h2>Task Information</h2>
<p>
In this task we are going to fix a shell command injection situation. You may
want to test the result of different user input separately to see what happens.
</p>

<p>
Our scenario is a simple one. In our application in Python, we want to list
files in a temporary directory used by our application for data processing.
The original code was:
</p>

<pre><code>  subprocess.run("ls -l", shell=True)</code></pre>

<p>
Then, another developer added user input for the directory with the raw user
data in the variable <tt>dir_to_list</tt> as follows:
</p>

<pre><code>def list_directory(dir_to_list):
    subprocess.run(f"ls -l {dir_to_list}", shell=True)
</pre></code>

<p>
This is a shell injection vulnerability.
An attacker can put arbitrary text into the parameter, which will be
executed by the shell.
It would safer to ensure
that only safe characters would be considered, <i>and</i> to
<i>not</i> invoke the shell at all.
By taking both steps, we make it much harder for an attacker
to find a way to work around it.
</p>

<p>
We can offer a few hints.
You'll need to modify a string to only contain alphanumerics.
Python's <tt>re.sub(PATTERN, REPLACETEXT, ORIGINAL_VALUE)</tt>
returns the result of substituting
<tt>PATTERN</tt> with
<tt>REPLACETEXT</tt> in <tt>ORIGINAL_VALUE</tt>, where <tt>PATTERN</tt>
is a regular expression written as a string.
By default <tt>re.sub</tt> substitutes all matches (that's what you want).
In Python regular expressions are usually expressed
using the "raw" string form, that is, using the <tt>r'...'</tt> syntax.
You need to stop invoking the shell in Python's
<tt>subprocess.run</tt>, including separating the arguments.
</p>

<p>
To be fair, a typical Python program wouldn't call "ls" directly.
We'll do that to keep the example simple, since there are times when
you need to invoke a shell.
</p>

<p>
Use the “hint” and “give up” buttons if necessary.
