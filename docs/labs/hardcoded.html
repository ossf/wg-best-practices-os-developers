hints:
- absent: |
    ^ \s* conn = DriverManager \. getConnection \( url \,
  text: >
    Your answer should start with 
    `conn = DriverManager.getConnection( url,`
    just as the initial value did. You might want to use the `Reset` button.
- absent: |
    System \. getenv
  text: >
    Use `System.getenv` to retrieve an environment variable value.
    For example, use `System.getenv("USERNAME")` to retrieve the username.
- present: |
    System \. getenv \( \"admin\" \)
  text: >
    You need to pass to
    `System.getenv` the name of an environment variable value, not the
    result you might get.
    Do not use constructs like `System.getenv("admin")`.
    Instead, for example,
    use `System.getenv("USERNAME")` to retrieve the username.
- absent: |
    System \. getenv \( \"PASSWORD\" \)
  text: >
    Use `System.getenv` to retrieve an environment variable value.
    For example, use `System.getenv("USERNAME")` to retrieve the username.
- present: "admin"
  text: >
    The term 'admin' should not be in your code.
    You should be retrieving both the username and the password
    from somewhere else, in this case, from environment variables.
- present: |
    (system|Getenv|GetEnv)
  text: >
    Java is case-sensitive. You need to use
    `System.getenv` and not some other variation of uppercase or lowercase.
- absent: |-
    \; \s* $

    Java statements must end with a semicolon.

    \) \) \; \s* $
  text: >
    Double-check your closing parentheses at the end of the statement.
- present: |
    new\s+String
  text: >
    You do not need to construct a new string to retrieve an
    environment variable value.
- present: |
    ^ conn = DriverManager \. getConnection \( url \) \; \s* $
  text: >
    In some sense this is correct, as long as the url is not hardcoded.
    However, it's often better if administrators can easily change the
    username or password separately, and it makes out point clearer.
    Please provide the username and password and separate values.
- present: |
    ^ \s* conn = DriverManager \. getConnection \( url \,
      System \. getenv \( "PASSWORD" \) \,
      System \. getenv \( "USERNAME" \) \) \; \s* $
  text: >
    The order of parameters is wrong. Provide the url, then the username,
    then the password. You're providing the url, then the password, then
    the username, which swaps the second and third parameters.

<h1>Lab Exercise hardcoded</h1>
<p>
This is a lab exercise on developing secure software.
For more information, see the <a href="introduction.html" target="_blank">introduction to
the labs</a>.

<p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>
<b>Please eliminate the hardcoded credentials in the sample code.</b>

<p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
In this exercise, we'll remove a hardcoded credential (in this case a
password) embedded in the code.

<p>
<h2>Task Information</h2>
<p>

<p>
Please change the Java code below to eliminate hardcoded credentials.
The code logs in to a database system, but uses
the hardcoded username "admin" with hardcoded password "admin".
At the very least, the password should <i>not</i> be exposed by
being hardcoded into the source code.
A credential that needs to be kept secret, like a password,
is too exposed and too hard to change when it's hardcoded into the code.
It would also be wiser to <i>not</i> hardcode the username, since
the username might change.

<p>
For our purposes, we'll modify the code to retrieve the username and
password as environment variable values.
The username (second parameter)
will be in environment variable <tt>USERNAME</tt> while
the password (third parameter)
will be in environment variable <tt>PASSWORD</tt>.
In Java the expression <tt>System.getenv("FOO")</tt> retrieves
the value of environment variable <tt>FOO</tt>.

<p>
Environment variables aren't a perfect solution, since they are typically
accessible to the entire program.
Other better mechanisms may be available on your platform.
In this example we'll use environment variables because they're
portable, easy to use, and
<i>certainly</i> better than using a hardcoded credential.
Note: Java also supports including the username and password in the url, but
for purposes of illustration we will not use that alternative.

<p>
Use the “hint” and “give up” buttons if necessary.
