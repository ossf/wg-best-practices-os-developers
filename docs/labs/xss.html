<h1>Lab Exercise xss</h1>
<p>
This is a lab exercise on developing secure software.
For more information, see the <a href="introduction.html" target="_blank">introduction to
the labs</a>.

<p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>
<b>Please practice countering Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) with Flask and the templating engine Jinja2.</b>

<p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
In this exercise, we'll implement
mechanisms to broadly counter Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks,
as
<a href="https://github.com/ossf/secure-sw-dev-fundamentals/blob/main/secure_software_development_fundamentals.md#countering-cross-site-scripting-xss"
>described in our course</a>.
We noted that "The standard way to counter XSS is
to escape all output that might
be from an attacker and is not specifically approved. ...  In most
cases, the best solution for XSS is to choose a framework or library
that automatically escapes HTML output for you."
That is, we want to use a system that automatically escapes
characters like "&lt;" by converting them into "&amp;lt;" 
unless we specifically note otherwise.
That way, those special characters are rendered harmless.
<p>
In <i>theory</i> you could call an escape routine every time you
make a call to generate an output.
In <i>practice</i> this approach is insecure,
because it's too easy to accidentally forget to call the escape routine.
It's instead safer to use mechanisms which escape <i>by default</i>.
<p>
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/Flask/"
>Flask</a> is a lightweight server-side web application framework
for the Python programming language.
Programs using Flask often use the
<a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/quickstart/#rendering-templates">Jinja2 template library</a>.
<a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/api/#autoescaping"
>Jinja2 has a mechanism for automatically escaping HTML</a>.
<p>
Jinja2's version 3.1.x series does <i>not</i>
enable this "autoescape" mode by default.
This may change in a future version of Jinja, but even so,
this serves as a great example.
In short, sometimes libraries must be specially configured to be
less dangerous to use.
This isn't ideal, but it can still be used.
You simply need to ensure that you correctly
configure the library to be used securely.
<p>
It turns out that
<a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/quickstart/#rendering-templates"
>Flask by default configures Jinja2 to automatically escape of HTML</a>.
So as far
as users of <i>Flask</i> are concerned, the Jinja templating system <i>does</i>
automatically escape HTML by default.

<p>
<h2>Task Information</h2>
<p>
Please change the code below to counter XSS vulnerabilities.
Use the “hint” and “give up” buttons if necessary.
This is a multi-part task; the specific task instructions are interspersed
below.

<p>
<h2>Interactive Lab (<span id="grade"></span>)</h2>

<h3>Part 1</h3>
<p>
In this part, you are <i>not</i> using Flask.
You're instead using Python and directly using the Jinja2 templating engine.
The version of Jinja2 we're considering
<a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/api/#basics"
>does <i>not</i> automatically escape unless it's configured to do so</a>.
Modify the Jinja2 configuration to automatically escape HTML, by passing
the field named <tt>autoescape</tt> with
<tt>select_autoescape()</tt> as its value.

<!--
You can use this an example for new labs.
For multi-line inputs, instead of <input id="attempt0" type="text" ...>, use
<textarea id="attempt" rows="2" cols="65">...</textarea>
-->
<form id="lab1"><pre><code
>from jinja2 import Environment, PackageLoader, select_autoescape
env = Environment(
    loader=PackageLoader("yourapp"),
<input id="attempt0" type="text" size="60" spellcheck="false" value="">
)
</code></pre>
<button type="button" class="hintButton">Hint</button>
<button type="button" class="resetButton">Reset</button>
<button type="button" class="giveUpButton">Give up</button>
</form>

<h3>Part 2</h3>
<p>
In this part
we <i>are</i> using Flask. Flask configures Jinja2 to automatically
escape HTML. The code below
(based on the
<a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/quickstart/#rendering-templates"
>Flask quickstart</a>)
uses Flask's template rendering system, which
in turn calls Jinja2 to render the result:
</p>

<pre><code
>from flask import render_template
@app.route('/hello/')
@app.route('/hello/<name>')
def hello(name=None):
    return render_template('hello.html', person=name)</code></pre>

<p>
The sample code above uses the template <tt>hello.html</tt>, which is
shown below.
Note that values to be substituted in the template
are surrounded by <tt>{{ ... }}</tt>.
<p>
Unfortunately, this template below has a vulnerability.
Its "| safe" marking tells the templating system that the data is
safe and shouldn't be escaped.
However, when the data <i>should</i> be escaped
(as is often the case), this would lead to a vulnerability.
For example, this would often lead to a vulnerability
if an attacker can slip characters like "&lt;" into a name,
Please fix this vulnerability.

<pre><code

&lt;title&gt;Hello from Flask&lt;/title&gt;
{% if person %}
<input id="attempt1" type="text" size="50" spellcheck="false"
 value="  &lt;h1&gt;Hello {{ person | safe }}!&lt;/h1&gt;">
{% endif %}
</code></pre>
<button type="button" class="hintButton">Hint</button>
<button type="button" class="resetButton">Reset</button>
<button type="button" class="giveUpButton">Give up</button>
</form>


<h3>Part 3</h3>
<p>
In this part we continue to use Flask.
However,
sometimes you need more sophisticated control over what is and is not escaped.
Most web application frameworks have a type or class that records
HTML values, and lets you specify what is to be escaped or not.
In Flask this typically done with its
<a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/templating/#controlling-autoescaping">Markup</a> class.
<p>
A instance of a <tt>Markup</tt> class is created by calling
<tt>Markup</tt>.
Whatever string is passed during its original construction
is assumed to be safe and is <i>not</i> escaped.
You can concatenate a normal string to a Markup value, but those additions
<i>will</i> be escaped.
<a href="https://tedboy.github.io/flask/generated/generated/flask.Markup.html"
>For example</a>, computing
<tt>Markup("&lt;em&gt;Hello&lt;/em&gt; ") + "&lt;foo&gt;"</tt>
produces a Markup instance containing the Unicode string value
<tt>'&lt;em&gt;Hello&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt;foo&amp;gt;'</tt> -
note how the first part isn't escaped but the latter part <i>is</i> escaped.
Since every concatenation will be escaped by default, the default is
the safe (escaping) operation.
The code also clearly indicates what is considered safe and what is not.
The Markup class supports many other methods not described here
to simplify control over what is escaped.
The templating system will directly include an instance of
Markup without further escapes, because
the Markup instance has already escaped whatever is supposed to be escaped.
<p>
The Python code below tries to use <tt>Markup</tt> to include a <tt>name</tt>.
However, it's incorrect and insecure.
The problem is that <tt>name</tt> is an untrusted value and
it shouldn't be passed directly to <tt>Markup</tt> as part of its trusted value.
Modify the code below so that <tt>result</tt> will include the <i>escaped</i>
version of <tt>name</tt>. Note that in Python <tt>+</tt> is the
string concatenation operation.
