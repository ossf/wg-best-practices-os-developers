# Best Practices for Open Source Developers

[![GitHub Super-Linter](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/workflows/Lint%20Code%20Base/badge.svg)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/super-linter)

Anyone is welcome to join our open discussions related to the group's mission and charter.

The BEST Working group is officially a [Graduated-level](https://github.com/ossf/tac/blob/main/process/working-group-lifecycle.md) working group within the OpenSSF <img align="right" src="https://github.com/ossf/tac/blob/main/files/images/OpenSSF_StagesBadges_graduated.png" width="100" height="100">

<img align="right" src="https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/blob/main/img/ossf-best-goose.png" width="300" height="300">

## Mission

Our Mission is to provide open source developers with security best practices recommendations and easy ways to learn and apply them.  

We seek to fortify the open-source ecosystem by championing and embedding best security practices, thereby creating a digital environment where both developers and users can trust and rely on open-source solutions without hesitation.

## Vision

- We envision a world where software developers can easily IDENTIFY good practices, requirements and tools that help them create and maintain secure world-class software, helping foster a community where security knowledge is shared and amplified.  
- We seek to provide means to LEARN techniques of writing and identifying secure software using methods best suited to learners of all types.
- We desire to provide tools to help developers ADOPT these good practices seamlessly into their daily work.

## Scope

The Developer Best Practices group wants to help identify and curate an accessible [inventory](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/blob/main/docs/inventory.md) of best practices

- Prioritized according to ROI for open source developers
- Categorized per technology, language, framework
- Community-curated

## Strategy

To achieve our Mission and Vision, the BEST Working group will execute on the following strategy:

- Collaborate with security experts to draft a comprehensive set of best practices tailored for open-source projects.
- Identify gaps in tools and resources that provide opportunities to promote and implement secure development practices.
- Evangelize and drive adoption of our artifacts (ex: guides, trainings, tools) through community outreach and targeted maintainer engagement.
- Collaborate with other OpenSSF and open source efforts to provide comprehensive guidance, advice, and tooling for software developers and open source software consumers to use, implement, and evaluate the security qualities of software.

## Roadmap

To deliver on our Strategy, the BEST Working Group will do the following:

- Evangelize OpenSSF “best practices” and tooling through blogs, podcasts, conference presentations, and the like.
-- Create a “Secure from the (open) source” expert podcast to showcase the work across the foundation.
-- As new guides/best practices are launched, we will create blogs and a conference presentation to raise awareness about it.
-- Amplify talks and artifacts created by other groups within the foundation
-- Create 3 EvilTux artifacts each quarter
- Create express learning classes for our body of work: working group explainer, SCM BP Guide, C/C++ Guide, Scorecard/Badges, Concise Guides
- Create a “Best Practices Member Badge” for member organizations
- Support and promote our sub-projects with contributions and feedback - Scorecard, BP Badges, OpenSSF - SkillFoundry, Classes, and Guides, Secure Software Guiding Principles (SSGP)
- Create a Memory Safety W3C-style workshop to assemble development leaders to talk about how to integrate memory safe languages and techniques more deeply into the oss ecosystem.
- Expand BEAR (Belonging, Empowerment, Allyship, and Representation) WG Office Hours to more broadly engage new-to-oss individuals and provide a forum for mentorship and guidance as they launch into and grow within their careers.
- Identify, curate, produce, and deliver new secure development education such as Developer Manager Training, Implementing/Integrating OSSF tools (such as Scorecard, Badges, OSV, OpenVEX, etc), advanced secure development techniques, and more.
- Evangelize and embed all of our guides across OpenSSF Technical Initiatives and understand what makes sense to integrate into Scorecard

## Help build a community

- Program to attract open source contributors and incentivize them to use and contribute to the inventory

Supply a Learning platform
-Any free course can be integrated into the platform

- The learner can follow a track, track their progress and get badges
- A suite of exercises are available for each best practice of the inventory

## Current Work

We welcome contributions, suggestions and updates to our projects. To contribute please fill in an [issue](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues) or create a [pull request](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pulls).

We typically use the [Simplest Possible Process (SPP)](https://best.openssf.org/spp/Simplest-Possible-Process) to publish and maintain the documents we publish; see the [SPP documentation](https://best.openssf.org/spp/Simplest-Possible-Process) if you have questions about it.

## Related Activities

There are many great projects both within and outside the Foundation that compliment and intersect our work here. Some other great projects/resources to explore:

- _SLSA Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts_ - <https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa>
  - Purpose - A security framework from source to service, giving anyone working with software a common language for increasing levels of software security and supply chain integrity

## Quick Start

### Areas that need contributions

- Any topics related to helping developers more easily make more secure software or consumers to better understand the security qualities of the software they wish to ingest

### Where to file issues

- Issues can be reviewed and filed [here](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues)
