Agenda



* Welcome new friends
* Is someone willing to scribe for the meeting?
* Call for opens (list new items below)
* Open pull requests - proposal to merge. Thomas has reviewed and queued up for team review. See: [https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Product%3A+Compiler+Hardening+Guide%22](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Product%3A+Compiler+Hardening+Guide%22)
    * More clearly distinguish -Werror with and without selectors [https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/345](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/345) - this is a precursor for adding specific -Werror=SELECTOR values, but before we do, we need to make it clear why it’s okay to do that.
    * Discuss further how to apply the guide [https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/328](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/328)
    * Add -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks and friends [https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/323](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/323)
    * Add threat model, goals, objectives - [https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/317](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/317) - this addresses previous meetings’ discussion, which concluded that there was a need for a brief threat model
* New issues and pull requests
    * Previous meeting discussion:
        * Add -Wbidi-chars=any to counter Trojan Source attacks and threat model, goals objective ([#283](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/283), PR [#317](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/317))
            * Deals with intentionally misleading malicious code
            * Siddhesh notes this is an IDE issue
            * All agree 283 is good, 317 we feel is good content that should be broken up and inserted along with the options, but as a whole, perhaps we create a dedicated threat model (appendix, supplementary/companion doc, etc)
        * Discuss further how to apply the guide ([#328](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/328))
            * Green vs brown field projects wording
            * We will wait for David’s response and we’ll discuss in a future call
        * Add -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks and friends ([#323](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/323))
            * Have discussed this several times in the past (somewhat controversial).  Options don't make sense for using in production use cases as it could hide some bugs
            * Guide now has made distinction between release and instrumented test code, that could allow us to add these items
            * Siddhesh - perhaps add the note it could mask bugs
            * Siddhesh - the mitigation is good, but might interfere with actually finding the bugs.  This should be disabled in test
            * Thomas - perhaps move these options to their own table, removing them from he more straight-forward ones
            * 
        * Review other documents for more C/C++ compiler option ideas ([#285](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/285))
            * Listing of source materials
            * Do we import the items as issues/prs
            * Group liked the sources.  Could explore the older Wheeler doc to see what we might want to integrate as group task next year
            * 
        * Evaluate -fsanitize-minimal-runtime for possible hardening ([#326](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/326))
            * 
        * Compiler flags notes/comments by Dominik Czarnota ([#330](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/330))
            * 
        * Clarify why -O2 ([#331](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/331))
            *

Agenda



* Welcome new friends
* Is someone willing to scribe for the meeting?
* Call for opens (list new items below)
* FOSDEM’24 talk proposal submitted by Thomas
    * [https://pretalx.fosdem.org/fosdem-2024/talk/review/LLFVWUWE9UEMTK8H3FYCR98K8WVRH7GQ](https://pretalx.fosdem.org/fosdem-2024/talk/review/LLFVWUWE9UEMTK8H3FYCR98K8WVRH7GQ)
    * Talks should be selected within the next week or two
    * There will be a GCC devroom. Siddhesh offers to help broker introductions to folks there.  
* Retrospective from journey to first release of the guide:
    * What did we do well?
        * Creating focused-”for purpose” dedicated group helped the team manage themselves, maintain velocity
        * Group was able to focus on technical work quickly, which was nice; the majority of the work was on making the guide better not administration or “foundation things”
        * Having a broad contributor base of subject matter experts was great
        * Built on a lot of existing good practices,helped guide the work and consolidate the practices (pulling from these many independent sources).  Helped highlight the consensus for the desired settings
        * Able to keep up to date on latest options and keep an eye on future developments (intaking future items that have not been widely tested will be a challenge for us)
        * Having a single location for this content is VERY useful
    * What have we learned?
        * Everyone learned a lot from the contributors (thank you!!)
        * There  is no roadmap laid out by the distros on how these are set and used
        * Having diverse contributions from the technologies and distros was extremely helpful
    * What should we do differently?
        * Consider pre-briefing select media/groups for future large updates or similar projects
        * Determining how to deal with and intake future contributions - unknown today
        * 
    * What do we not understand?
        * 
* Open pull requests - proposal to merge. Thomas has reviewed and queued up for team review
    * Add -mshstk and -fsanitize=safe-stack to considered options (PR [#311](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/311))
        * Has already gotten some review/comments
        * Allows gcc to interact with shadowstack
        * Fsanitize splits the stack
        * Team agrees to merge
    * Mend fences - use 3 not 4 characters (PR [#324](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/324))
        * Minor formatting change
        * Team agrees to merge
        * There is a dependency for 325 here
    * Improve Makefile so we can more flexibly test options (PR [#325](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/325))
        * Adds printing of options
        * Team agrees to merge (after thomas fixes minor issue)
    * compiler options: simplify and clarify rpath section (PR [#327](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/327))
        * 1st time contributor went through an editing pass to make it more readable
        * Bonus note on priv escalation
        * Team agrees to merge
    * best -> good (PR [#329](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/329))
        * Based on discussion from slack
        * Toning text down from “best” to “good”
        * Team agrees to merge
* New issues and pull requests
    * Add -Wbidi-chars=any to counter Trojan Source attacks and threat model, goals objective ([#283](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/283), PR [#317](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/317))

<h3>Meeting Notes</h3>




* **We agree to defer next call and January 2nd call; our next meeting will be 16 Jan.**
* Next TAC will be asking all the working groups to declare at what stage in the wg lifecycle they’re in. So what maturity level do we think this group is in? Then we will be filing that issue in the TAC to register that: [https://github.com/ossf/tac/blob/main/process/working-group-lifecycle.md](https://github.com/ossf/tac/blob/main/process/working-group-lifecycle.md) - CROB to create a github issue.
    * Dan: I think it’s pretty clear we’re “graduated”.
    * Crob: agreed it’s not a lot of work.
* Crob: **talks about deliverables** C/C++; secure software guiding principles (lots have signed up to it so far); 
* Looking at the Roadmap of the MVSR - 
    * Evangelizing the best practices of the group - who can help? Please submit - also reach outside of the OpenSSF bubble.
    * We committed to write 3 evil tux blog posts each quarter… we need to identify 3 things a quarter - technical blog posts that reach developers / practitioners. 
* *some discussion on use of AI in writing*
* Crob: will be uploading my presentation to github repo so people can use this material for their own presentations.
* Evangelizing and getting broader adoption of our work across the foundation - we need to volunteers to sit in various other calls…  Ryan Ware volunteers for scorecard specifically.
* Working on the idea of a w3c-wstyle workshop on **memory safety** across the ecosystem: rust folks; gcc folks; w3c-style workshop - we have a topic and people would present papers - suggestions of things we should consider… this could add value to this topic. Need to start planning - sooner rather than later… 
* Elections are starting now - please fill out the nomination for TAC or SCIR…  Also [register to vote](https://forms.gle/7suYexAnPxndvX856).

Agenda



* Welcome new friends
* Is someone willing to scribe for the meeting?
* Call for opens (list new items below)
* Blogpost to accompany initial release. Draft available at: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pqxOBxhH95XcbY-dNj1e8BMrH9bSgFIsQvgP7E7oz1c/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pqxOBxhH95XcbY-dNj1e8BMrH9bSgFIsQvgP7E7oz1c/edit)
* Upcoming event opportunities. Talk proposal for [FOSDEM’24](https://fosdem.org/2024/)?
* Wishes for C/C++ Compiler BP Guide calls over the upcoming holidays? Skip some calls? Retrospective?
* Recent issues & PRs:
    * Options -Wtrampolines and -fstack-clash-protection not universal ([#277](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/277))
    * fix -fPIC -shared taking precedence (PR [#276](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/276))  - at least eliminate compilation errors!
    * Compiler Hardening Guide should refer to more compilers based on GCC and clang ([#251](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/251), PR [#290](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/290))
    * Update compiler guide contributors (PR [#291](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/291))
    * Add -Wbidi-chars=any to counter Trojan Source attacks ([#283](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/283))
    * Review other documents for more C/C++ compiler option ideas ([#285](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/285))
    * In C/C++ hardening guide discuss instrumented vs production code ([#298](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/298))

<h4>Opens</h4>




* Versioned or rolling releases after initial publication?  
* David wished to discuss [#298](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/298) to potentially address it before initial release.

<h4>Guide Notes</h4>




* The call started with a discussion around ways of working with the guide after initial publication announcement. David suggested following the precedent set by the Concise guides, with a the text “”by the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) Best Practices Working Group, <date>” added to the top the guide (underneath title) and the date updated after new content is merged. Major milestones for the guide could still be announced in appropriate channels. It was decided to adopt the practice for now.
* The blogpost draft was reviewed by the participants. CRob agreed to be listed as co-author. After some minor editing it was decided that the blogpost can be sent to the OpenSSF TAC for review.
* Thomas announced he and Georg are planning to submit a talk proposal on the guide to FOSDEM’24. The devroom has not been decided yet. If anyone is interested to do a joint talk they should contact Thomas and Georg as soon as possible. FOSDEM submission deadline is Dec 1st, 2023. CRob offered to review the proposal before submission.
* Thomas asked about whether the participants wished the calls to continue in December or whether to have a break over the Holidays. It was decided that, assuming the release of the guide proceeds as planned, to hold a retrospective of the past year on December 6th. December 22 call will be canceled. Thomas will contact OpenSSF operations to arrange cancelation.
* Recent issues & PRs:
    * [#298](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/298) (Moved up the agenda on David’s request) - There was a brief discussion around the proposed term “instrumented test code” to refer to builds that are built with options that can detect code quality and security issues, but that are not suitable for production use. Thomas noted that “instrumented code” is a common term in academic papers when referring to code which is built with compiler-based defenses. Overall there was support for adding the proposed section. David will propose draft text in a future PR
    * [#277](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/277), PR [#276](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/276) - Thomas presented a proposal for situational options table in TL;DR list. David suggested that the table could be pivoted to allow for it to grow as new options are added ([#300](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/300)). David’s suggestion received unanimous support.
    * [#251](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/251), PR [#290](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/290) - David noted that the AdaPro C and C++ compiler is called “AdaCore GNAT Pro Enterprise” and that AdaPro GNAT may cause confusion with the upstream GCC Ada compiler. Thomas will fix the name and then merge the PR.
    * PR [#291](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/291) - Thomas noted he has updated the list of contributors before the initial release and contacted the persons added to get their consent to appear in the list. He gave them a deadline of November 29th for the acknowledgement to make it into the initial release version.
    * [#283](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/283) - David gave a summary of the “underhanded source code” threat and the possible fixes proposed in [#283](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/283). There was overall support for including the -Wbidi-chars=any but more in-depth discussion was postponed to a future call due to time constraints.

Addendum: Thomas submitted the blogpost draft and link to guide to the OpenSSF TAC mailing list later the same day and notified Jennifer Bly that the blogpost was done and submitted to the TAC for review.

<h3>New Friends</h3>




* No new friends today.

<h3>Opens</h3>




* Please accept change to docs/Concise-Guide-for-Evaluating-Open-Source-Software.md proposed in [https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/246](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/246) , “Propose adding a tentative addition”. This proposes adding this point when reviewing a potential new component:
    * **What happens on a test addition?** Try adding the dependency as a test, preferably in an isolated environment, to investigate its impact:
        * 1. Does it exhibit malicious behaviour, e.g., does it attempt to exfiltrate sensitive data?
        * 2. Does it add unexpected or unnecessary indirect dependencies in production? For example, does it include production dependencies that are only required at development time or test time instead? If so, would their maintainers be willing to fix that? Every new dependency is a potential support problem or supply chain attack, so it's wise to eliminate unnecessary ones.
    * It also renumbers the following point (so it looks like it changes more than it does)
    * This was accepted per discussion below; you can see th result here: [https://best.openssf.org/Concise-Guide-for-Evaluating-Open-Source-Software](https://best.openssf.org/Concise-Guide-for-Evaluating-Open-Source-Software)

<h3>Backlog Review</h3>




* 

<h3>Meeting Notes</h3>




* 2023 summary will come in the next months… Thanks to all who participated in SCM and Compiler guide and ongoing interest.  If anyone has ideas for other initiatives, we will continue toi provide updates to those but if you have other ideas we can set up small groups.
* **Compiler guide** [Thomas Nyman]: FYI update - working hard on getting initial version into a shape where we’re proud to publish it. Not intended to be a finished product but you can consider it a MVP. We’ve been preparing a blog post. Current plan we aim to post it Nov 29. Still working on sign-off on text. It might slip but hope is to get it out by end of nov - and some mention in upcoming OpenSSF day Japan…  \
Link to draft here: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pqxOBxhH95XcbY-dNj1e8BMrH9bSgFIsQvgP7E7oz1c/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pqxOBxhH95XcbY-dNj1e8BMrH9bSgFIsQvgP7E7oz1c/edit) 
* Best practices badge picked a new logo - that will be updated in the coming weeks - a new blog on “evil tux” to be posted about the badge. Scope for coordinating neytwe
* Educational material - David has been collecting info and coming up with proposal… will share soon.
* Dan: suggest a deliverable possibling coming out of the [Secure the Web Forward](https://www.w3.org/2023/03/secure-the-web-forward/) workshop - something addressing needs of web developers
* Seth: Python guide similar to NPM guide
* Avishay: memory safety SIG - we want to provide memory safety recommendations for languages that are memory safe but could be made unsafe… Could we do that under memory safety SIG?
    * Crob - probably best and then we get the word out…  Every time we talk to US gov they are interested in memory safety - EU commission have similar concerns….
    * Thomas: I also think that’s great.
* Seth: Rust guide … would be good.
* David: between linux kernel and curl we have lots of experience of re-writing portions of things in Rust. Linux kernel is adding support for device drivers in rust - device drivers is the thing they’re most worried about. Interesting side effect: Rust really “likes” certain kind of calls and not others, and the kinds it likes are less likely to produce vulnerabilities. They’ve modified parts of the Linux kernel in C to be friendlier to Rust callers. The unexpected effect of the changes is to reduce the likelihood of certain problems, sometimes helpful. Also changing their use of C … to reduce certain kinds of defects.
* Crob: tools: new guides; blogs; conferences; 
* Seth: lowering the bar - you don’t have to “rewrite” it in Rust - middle ground - could be easier to achieve if you have concrete examples & stories.
* **PR 246**: update the concise guides… [https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/246](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/246) [see above] - All agreed to it, it was merged during the meeting. Note: The change looks larger than it is, it renumbers “9” to “10” which caused many trivial changes

<h3>Project Updates</h3>

Agenda



* Welcome new friends
* Is someone willing to scribe for the meeting?
* Mark noted:
* [https://airbus-seclab.github.io/c-compiler-security/](https://airbus-seclab.github.io/c-compiler-security/)
* [https://github.com/jvoisin/compiler-flags-distro](https://github.com/jvoisin/compiler-flags-distro)
* Blogpost to accompany initial release
* Draft available at: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pqxOBxhH95XcbY-dNj1e8BMrH9bSgFIsQvgP7E7oz1c/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pqxOBxhH95XcbY-dNj1e8BMrH9bSgFIsQvgP7E7oz1c/edit)
* Marketing request has been submitted. Regarding the timing, Jennifer Bly mentioned she would prefer to spread out the marketing announcements in time, i.e., if we want to publish a blogpost, it would be best not to do that right on top of OpenSSF Day Japan (Dec 4th). Instead, at the day itself, it would be mentioned that the release of the guide has happened. To accommodate this, Georg suggested aiming for Nov 14th, which is quite soon. Thomas has reached out to CRob for WG lead approval. There should also be time for review by the TAC.
* Long discussion about timing. We’ve been trying for an aggressive deadline - is this too aggressive?
* We are taking two more weeks for further improvements and discussing the open PRs listed below. The new target date is the last week of November.
* We are planning to inform the TAC about the final version on the meeting of November 22
* We collected plenty of high-quality feedback from across the OpenSSF and external experts, therefore we won't open for another round of feedback
* There are a number of outstanding PRs, need to try to work/merge them
* Recent issues & PRs:
    * Compiler Hardening Guide should include -fcf-protection ([#247](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/247), PR [#260](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/260))  - _David flagged this as important to address before initial release_
        * #260 is good to go in, even if it extends the TL;DR section
    * Add -mshstk to the C/C++ Compiler Hardening Guide? ([#267](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/267))
    * Options -Wtrampolines and -fstack-clash-protection not universal ([#277](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/277))
    * fix -fPIC -shared taking precedence (PR [#276](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/276)) 
    * Compiler Hardening Guide should refer to more compilers based on GCC and clang ([#251](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/251))
    * Continue review of issue [97](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/97) and early OpenSSF [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SslnJuqbFUyTFnhzkhC_Q3PPGZ1zrG89COrS6LV6pz4/edit) 
* David: It’s important in the long-term 
* Call for opens (list new items below)

    * Georg & David A. Wheeler talked with Jennifer Bly about getting the word out once it’s released - we need to provide her some info  - she will provide a link for a form to fill in to get started, who should that go to?
        * OpenSSF marketing input form: [https://form.asana.com/?k=j8rQ7mfRzGCg9pR8X0RHBg&d=9283783873717](https://form.asana.com/?k=j8rQ7mfRzGCg9pR8X0RHBg&d=9283783873717) 
* Recent issues & PRs:
    * Add note in table 1 about -Werror ([#149](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/149), PR [#253](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/253)) - _David flagged this as important to address before initial release_ - remove -Werror from TLDR, change paragraph on it 1 sentence, move details to lower section
    * Add note about system includes to hardening guide (PR [#259](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/259)) - related to above
    * Add -Wimplicit-fallthrough (PR [#262](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/262)) - _David flagged this as important to address before initial release_
        * Add citation: https://eel.is/c++draft/dcl.attr.fallthrough
    * When compiling compilers, make their defaults secure (PR [#261](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/261)) - _David flagged this as important to address before initial release_
        * Thomas will try to move into its own section
        * Performance issues matter
        * We don’t need all the details, just point out the importance and list examples (1 GCC, one clang)
    * Add -fstrict-flex-arrays. Fixes [#249](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/249) (PR [#263](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/263/)) - _David flagged this as important to address before initial release_
        * We’ll add discussion about the other levels, but encourage the use of level 3
        * Some use levels 0…2 because they’re using old compilers that don’t support C99 (e.g., vim)
        * Thomas will propose text to explain levels 0..2
        * Levels documented in the -Wstrict-flex-arrays section in the gcc man page
    * Add branch protection flags (PR [#260](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/260)) - _David flagged this as important to address before initial release_

<h4>Guide Notes</h4>




* Need a blog post for announcement. Currently in form of google doc.  Issues identified with  FORTIFY=3.  Anyone interested should request access.  Still targeting the event in Japan at the beginning of December.  Recommendations: avoid the period of Thanksgiving in the US for release.
* Issues found by FORTIFY: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gcc-13/+bug/2012440/comments/1
* Any other concerns/formalities regarding release?
* Pull Requests:
    * Resolve controversy around -Werror: issue #149 + pull request #253.  Remove -Werror from the TLDR; but keep the description in the table.  Merge change before next meeting.
    * #259: Approved in principle.  To be merged before next meeting.
    * #262: C++’s description of [[fallthrough]]: https://eel.is/c++draft/dcl.attr.fallthrough

        Resolution: Accepted in principle. To be merged before next meeting.

* #261: David suggests to record the issue, but no pressing need to have it resolved before release 1.0.  Needs more iterations.
* #263: Encourage use of 3 as default.  Accepted in principle.

Agenda



* Welcome new friends
* Is someone willing to scribe for the meeting?
* Call for opens (list new items below)
* Is anyone interested in co-leading this project?
* Review existing guide
* Open Issues
    * We closed issue 102 [Issues · ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers (github.com)](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/102)
    * Taking a look at #155 [Add Azure DevOps to SCM Best Practices · Issue #155 · ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers (github.com)](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/155) we think while we want to incorporate other SCM platforms the relative priority of Azure is probably low compared to some others?  Also - we need people who can provide that info - and the expertise; also it’s not open, it’s for private… So maybe we should close this?
    * #153 [generic language vs contextual guidance · Issue #153 · ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers (github.com)](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/153) - lots of language and guidance specific to particular personas… a lot of things not applicable to all personas who might be reading this doc…
        * How to account for this without inordinate complexity… 
        * Some of comments are general comments - 
        * For personas we could map it to the personas documented in the personas work (e.g. written by the toolbelt effort). [toolbelt/personas at main · ossf/toolbelt (github.com)](https://github.com/ossf/toolbelt/tree/main/personas)
        * Agreed we don’t want multiple documents - multiple pages one for each personas - we need to keep it simple.
        * “Be permissive of when a particular recommendation would apply…”
        * Could be an indent under each item…
        * Also there’s some duplication…
* Next steps
    * Probably to replay above on the next BP call and schedule a working session to go through ideas in #153.

Agenda



* Welcome new friends
* Is someone willing to scribe for the meeting?
* Call for opens (list new items below)
* RFC to be announced on OpenSSF BEST WG mailing list [[Draft announcement](https://gist.github.com/thomasnyman/e883c4339ce01046ad14b345122a089b)]
    * By when should we ask feedback to be provided? 
        * Based on discussion Thomas will give 2 weeks for feedback.
        * There was also support to have a blog post to accompany the initial release. Thomas will create a Google Doc for drafting the blogpost and bring it up on the agenda for the next call.
* Recent issues:
    * Continuing discussion on guidance for GCC's -fstack-protector on Aarch64 ([#234](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/234), PR[ #235](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/235)) - Thomas has updated PR[ #235](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/235) based on discussion on [2023-09-27](#bookmark=id.863n4hp4nw9q).
        * Siddhest and David commented on the wording on GitHub
        * Discussion around whether to include or not include CVE number in main text. As a compromise it was agreed to refer to the CVE in a reference but not in the main text.
    * Reopened by David: Discussion on -Wall and production code vs. production of code in ([#149](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/149)) 
        * It was agreed to leave the issue open in anticipation for bigger restructuring around separate recommendation for debug, test, and production flags. 
    * Proposals for new additions from discussion on [2023-09-27](#bookmark=id.863n4hp4nw9q):
        * -ftrivial-auto-var-init ([#245](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/245)) - 
            * Siddhesh noted the performance regression reported by systemd developers should be noted in the description
        * -fcf-protection ([#247](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/247)) 
            * Siddhesh noted that there are other architecture-specific flags that should be considered
        * -fstrict-flex-arrays ([#249](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/249))
            * Siddhesh noted that -fstrict-flex-arrays is now used in Linux kernel.

The rest of the items on the agenda were postponed for the next call.



* Continue review of issue [97](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/97) and early OpenSSF [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SslnJuqbFUyTFnhzkhC_Q3PPGZ1zrG89COrS6LV6pz4/edit)

Agenda



* Is someone willing to scribe for the meeting today?
* Welcome new friends
    * Jared Miller (SAP)
    * Dana Wang (LF)
* Call for opens (list new items below)
* WG Administrivia/bookkeeping/backlog review
* Sub-project updates (as needed)
* Review, discuss, and adopt/reject MVSR:

**Mission**

Our Mission is to provide open source developers with security best practices recommendations and easy ways to learn and apply them.  We seek to fortify the open-source ecosystem by championing and embedding best security practices, thereby creating a digital environment where both developers and users can trust and rely on open-source solutions without hesitation.

**Vision**

We envision a world where software developers can easily IDENTIFY good practices, requirements and tools that help them create and maintain secure world-class software, helping foster a community where security knowledge is shared and amplified.  We seek to provide means to LEARN techniques of writing and identifying secure software using methods best suited to learners of all types. We desire to provide tools to help developers ADOPT these good practices seamlessly into their daily work.

**Strategy**

To achieve our Mission and Vision, the BEST Working group will execute on the following strategy:



1. Collaborate with security experts to draft a comprehensive set of best practices tailored for open-source projects.
2. Identify gaps in tools and resources that provide opportunities to promote and implement secure development practices.
3. Evangelize and drive adoption of our artifacts (ex: guides, trainings, tools) through community outreach and targeted maintainer engagement.
4. Collaborate with other OpenSSF and open source efforts to provide comprehensive guidance, advice, and tooling for software developers and open source software consumers to use, implement, and evaluate the security qualities of software.

**Roadmap**

To deliver on our Strategy, the BEST Working Group will do the following:



* Evangelize OpenSSF “best practices” and tooling through blogs, podcasts, conference presentations, and the like.
    * Create a “Secure from the (open) source” expert podcast to showcase the work across the foundation.
    * As new guides/best practices are launched, we will create blogs and a conference presentation to raise awareness about it.
    * Amplify talks and artifacts created by other groups within the foundation
    * Create 3 EvilTux artifacts each quarter
* Create express learning classes for our body of work: working group explainer, SCM BP Guide, C/C++ Guide, Scorecard/Badges, Concise Guides
* Create a “Best Practices Member Badge” for member organizations
* Support and promote our sub-projects with contributions and feedback - Scorecard, BP Badges, OpenSSF - SkillFoundry, Classes, and Guides, Secure Software Guiding Principles (SSGP)
* Create a Memory Safety W3C-style workshop to assemble development leaders to talk about how to integrate memory safe languages and techniques more deeply into the oss ecosystem.
* Expand DEI AMA Office Hours to more broadly engage new-to-oss individuals and provide a forum for mentorship and guidance as they launch into and grow within their careers.
* Identify, curate, produce, and deliver new secure development education such as Developer Manager Training, Implementing/Integrating OSSF tools such as Scorecard, Badges, OSV, OpenVEX, etc), advanced secure development techniques, and more.
* On Roadmap above, do we want to commit to taking all of our guides and seeing what makes sense to integrate into Scorecard?
*

Agenda



* Welcome new friends
* Is someone willing to scribe for the meeting?
* Call for opens (list new items below)
* When to announce the RFC for the compiler options guide on the OpenSSF mailing list?
    * Among those present there were no objections for announcing RFC on mailing list. Thomas will prepare the announcement.
* Recent issues:
    * [CVE-2023-40339](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40339) affecting GCC's -fstack-protector on Aarch64 ([#234](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/234), PR[ #235](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/235)) - active discussion in the issue on whether addressing specific vulnerabilities is appropriate for the guide.  \
How should the guide address vulnerabilities in recommended options?

Is recommending the latest compiler versions sufficient?

* Siddhesh noted that most compiler hardening features can be affected by heuristics which may not give consistent results in all configuration. Listing ALL caveats which may adversely affect coverage may require too much effort from a guide maintenance point of view and detract from the main goal of the document: listing good practices. Addressing the broader concern may require a separate project.
* Given the specific concerns, it can be argued that the issue affecting GCC may not be a vulnerability at all and the assignment of the CVE may be “jumping the gun” (related recent talk by Siddhesh: [https://siddhesh.in/files/Security-Processes.pdf](https://siddhesh.in/files/Security-Processes.pdf))
* William Huhn commented that from a practitioner point-of-view, the issue is something that really should be cleared about. The CVE system is important in getting people to take action.
* One approach to address the issue would be to direct to use the latest branch from GCC 7 onwards should be ok + general guidance on not using unsupported compiler versions 
* Gabriel noted that intent of the document should not be to jump on every CVE, but in this particular case the severity  wide applicability justifies discussion and describing the issue. The CVE number helps in disambiguating the issue, and may be justified to refer.
* Siddhart commented that it might be useful to also include sample code that illustrates the issue.
* Thomas will make attempt at rewording current PR to “tone down” CVE aspect, but addressing how deployers of stack-protector can get better results going forward by using appropriate versions of GCC.    
    * Compiler Hardening Guide should recommend -fhardened ([#240](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/240)) 
-fhardened is an umbrella option that in the current proposal enables:
        * -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3 (or =2 for older glibcs)
        * -D_GLIBCXX_ASSERTIONS
        * [-ftrivial-auto-var-init=zero](https://gcc.gnu.org/pipermail/gcc-patches/2021-February/565514.html) (not currently covered by guide)
        * -fPIE  -pie  -Wl,-z,relro,-z,now
        * -fstack-protector-strong
        * -fstack-clash-protection
        * -fcf-protection=full (x86 only, not currently covered by guide)

            Siddhesh noted the flag is under discussion and is currently targeting GCC 14. Another caveat is that the specific flags enabled by -fhardened may shift from version to version in GCC. Unclear how to address that in the guider. 


            Gabriel suggested keeping the issue open until the option is available in an official GCC release (expected in May 2024).


            William Huhn noted he likes the flag but was worried whether the sub-options enabled -fhardened have been vetted for performance. Siddhesh noted that the features proposed to be included by -fhardened are standard options used by Linux distributions. He also noted the proposal excluded options that may have been controversial (but these decisions may change in future releases)


            Siddhesh noted that -ftrivial-auto-ver-init=zero has [potential performance issues](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=111523). There’s also -fstrict-flex-arrays.


            It was decided to keep the issue open until -fhardened is available in an official GCC release but work on the additions to the guide can proceed in the meanwhile as the discussion around the functionality stabilizes in the GCC community.   

    * Missing Binutils version for -rpath and --enable-new-dtags ([#164](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/164), PR [#233](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/233))
        * Merged after brief discussion.

The rest of the items on the agenda were postponed for the next call.



* Reopened by David: Discussion on -Wall and production code vs. production of code in ([#149](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/149)) 
* Continue review of issue [97](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/97) and early OpenSSF [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SslnJuqbFUyTFnhzkhC_Q3PPGZ1zrG89COrS6LV6pz4/edit)

* Welcome new friends
* Call for opens (list new items below)
* WG Administrivia/bookkeeping/backlog review
* Sub-project updates (as needed)
* Memory Safety SIG update (Avishey):
    * Memory Safety Project Support Program:  [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IYSVyOdXK7cvep0shr33tXvUlSTmCllG6LJHiNfVrWM/edit#heading=h.p7dcxo3ha8e1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IYSVyOdXK7cvep0shr33tXvUlSTmCllG6LJHiNfVrWM/edit#heading=h.p7dcxo3ha8e1) 
        * Please review & comment!!
    * David: Funding: That has to be approved by someone with funding authority. Small amounts might be possible via sos.dev, but larger amounts need to be approved by GB or from existing accounts. Alpha-Omega is funding Rustls (via Prossimo) and Rust in the Linux kernel.
    * David A. Wheeler: US government is very interested in memory-safe languages.
* What about OpenSSF AI/ML WG
    * David: AI/ML tools’ code generation is amazing, but they’re trained on insecure code, so they tend to generate insecure code, as shown by experiments.
    * Victor Lu created this document:  [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1veEdcQAqf2KhXTf7YlOW_lIif8kCDNgLGRqLqi70F44/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1veEdcQAqf2KhXTf7YlOW_lIif8kCDNgLGRqLqi70F44/edit)
    * OpenSSF AI/ML WG collaborates with AI & Data Foundation, which is GREAT, because we need collaboration of the security experts & the AI/ML experts
    * OpenSSF AI/ML Working Group Meeting Notes: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hEJdr7yXv5tfYpUfn_e7DAUTyvoU6mY0b9eH6EXAHaI/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hEJdr7yXv5tfYpUfn_e7DAUTyvoU6mY0b9eH6EXAHaI/edit)
    * Might be useful to remind AI/ML that you also need to use the capabilities of “normal” code
    * AI & Data Foundation is short-staffed
    * David A. Wheeler: My graduate course includes material on AI & Security: :[https://dwheeler.com/secure-class/presentations/Secure-Software-10-Misc.ppt](https://dwheeler.com/secure-class/presentations/Secure-Software-10-Misc.ppt)
* What about ONCD RFI
    * OpenSSF is working on a response in a committee

Agenda



* Welcome new friends
* Is someone willing to scribe for the meeting?
* Call for opens (list new items below)
* When to announce the RFC for the compiler options guide on the OpenSSF mailing list?
* Recent issues:
    * [CVE-2023-40339](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40339) affecting GCC's -fstack-protector on Aarch64 ([#234](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/234), PR[ #235](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/235)) - on a broader note, how should the guide address vulnerabilities in recommended options? Add a “caveats” section, other considerations?
    * Missing Binutils version for -rpath and --enable-new-dtags ([#164](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/164), PR [#233](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/233))
    * Reopened by David: Discussion on -Wall and production code vs. production of code in ([#149](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/149)) 
    * Continue review of issue [97](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/97) and early OpenSSF [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SslnJuqbFUyTFnhzkhC_Q3PPGZ1zrG89COrS6LV6pz4/edit)

<h4>Guide Notes</h4>




* Chris: I will work on something for github/gitlab… - github and gitlab icons - people don’t know they can be clicked on - and they’re terrible for accessibility.
* Dan: totally agree -
* Christine: PR to re-organize some of the repositories sections… mix of configurations vs. best practices (e.g. update repo frequently - not really a configuration).
* … also use of the word _should_.
* Christine: another feedback we got from people working with lots of repositories - how can you add these things at scale. Rulesets in GitHub - related to branch protection - but should be more at the top level.
* Dan: suggest Operations / Specific Recommendations - and making it a small item.
* Regulatory
    * Dan: looking for feedback on how SCM guide fits together with regulations - David Wheeler’s view is that the regulation 
    * Aeva: some NIST guidelines are relevant to SCM… Yes it could be valuable in a guide to map things to regulatory requirements - but be careful on wording that it would fulfill - maybe “might fulfill” or “similar” – or connecting and saying “here are the frameworks you should know about.”
    * Christine: could this be level up?
    * Aeva:
  [M-22-18 (whitehouse.gov)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/M-22-18.pdf); 
  [NIST Special Publication 800-series General Information | NIST](https://www.nist.gov/itl/publications-0/nist-special-publication-800-series-general-information)
    * Aeva: advise high level guidance…
* Blog post to go out 14-Sep: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PaXZOd7dnGZMmhvqnvvsQ2WxhimlzClwvCq1jqsv29s/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PaXZOd7dnGZMmhvqnvvsQ2WxhimlzClwvCq1jqsv29s/edit) 
* Christine to do a talk at OpenSSF day…
* _we take a look at Chris’s proposal_
    * First option that Chris presents just adds text links for github and gitlab - 
* Chris: suggest a table…
* Dan: suggest a table for next steps… after the current announcement.
* Chris: also tables not easy to manipulate when they get large…  - although table would look neater…
* **We agree to go with option 1- adding text links for github and gitlab and adding “Applies to:” for items that don’t have singleton pages**
* **We agree to skip next call as it’ll be Open Source Summit EU…**

Agenda



* Welcome new friends
* Is someone willing to scribe for the meeting?
* Call for opens (list new items below)
* Status on preparation for first release
    * More cleanup has been done
    * Update of README still as todo
* Review proposed pull requests:
    * Move -D_LIBCPP_ASSERT to list of considered options ([#225](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/225)) - to be replaced with libc++ “hardened mode”
* Review existing issue [97](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/97) and early OpenSSF [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SslnJuqbFUyTFnhzkhC_Q3PPGZ1zrG89COrS6LV6pz4/edit) 
    * -Wl,--hash-style=gnu option in guide draft may have been added as alternative to _DT_HASH_ in 2006 which at least have been slow, although it is unclear whether this has had any security implication [https://sourceware.org/pipermail/libc-alpha/2022-August/141304.html](https://sourceware.org/pipermail/libc-alpha/2022-August/141304.html)
    * -Wl,--no-copy-dt-needed-entries and -Wl,--as-needed affect symbol resolution in a way that allows symbols defined in dynamic libraries to be later replaced, similar to LD_PRELOAD, but using a more obscure mechanism [https://github.com/elfmaster/dt_infect](https://github.com/elfmaster/dt_infect). This has a security implication, but the description needs to be amended to more clearly explain this
    * `-fexceptions `can be security-relevant for multi-threaded applications as without unwind tables there is a higher risk of deadlock 
    * The implications -fasynchronous-unwind-tables is unclear, although it might be related to the unwind table implementation in compilers. Gabriel offered to follow-up with Florian Weimer who made the original suggestion to the incubation guide.
    * -fplugin=annobin seems to be specific to Red Hat, maybe should be covered in considered options table
    * `-grecord-gcc-switches` may be relevant from a QA-perspective since it can allow determining which (hardening) flags were used, although it may not always be practical for production code. Could be included in a debug-build specific table. 
* Next steps
    * Georg raised the question whether we should target announcing the RFC for the compiler guide either before the OSSummit in Bilbao on Sep 19-20, 2023 or after. It was agreed to put this on the agenda for the next meeting.

    * [Chris] It’s not obvious that the GitHub and GitLab icons are clickable links, and that they lead to explanations. Plus the links are not accessible.
        * **Chris**: to send a **PR addressing accessibility**, ex: using text links 
    * [Christine] Managing repos at scale is hard to do with the guidelines.
        * [Chris] Suggest having language that recommends setting organization-wide policies.
        * [Christine] For handling repos at scale could invite the community to contribute scripts, etc. via discussions
    * [Chris] Some of the recommendations are a mix of configurations and other “best practices” ex: repository updates.
        * **Christine**: Send a PR **organizing the Repository section** recommendations to see if it reads better
    * Scorecard above 7 feedback says they don’t want to be penalized for a low score. 
        * [Chris] These are recommendations and should not be seen as penalizing. The guide does have language of these being recommendations.
    * Would like to see the guide formulated more as a list of possibilities than a list of things you "should" do.
        * **Christine: request suggestion on what language would work better**.
* GitHub rulesets feedback from Legitify. Not looking to put it in their tooling and suggest having these in the SCM guide
    * We could put it in the GitHub top-level README
        * **Christine**: send a PR **adding rulesets**
    * We don’t have GitLab expertise in this project. Hopefully the community can jump in and contribute post-launch.
    * [Chris] Suggest putting a call-to-action in various channels
    * [Christine] Can to a CTA at TODO group meetings and at OSS EU in September

Agenda



* Is someone willing to scribe for the meeting today?
* Welcome new friends
* Call for opens (list new items below)
* WG Administrivia/bookkeeping/backlog review
* Sub-project updates (as needed)
* Review Secure Software Guiding Principles (formerly “Covenant”) - Jessica M - [BP PR 212](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/212)
* Discuss GH [Discussions ](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/discussions)and how we can use it
* Group Discussion - Would the BP Wg like to adopt the Security Toolbelt - [BP Issue 207](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/207)
* Who would like to assist in crafting an MVSR for the BEST WG - [BP Issue 214](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/214)
* Chris: meeting link in this doc is incorrect-ish (it’s for SCM meeting on 2023-09-07)
* [Broader discussion about how to improve communication]
* We’re moving bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org -> [www.bestpractices.dev](www.bestpractices.dev) - staging works, plan to do this to the “real site” soon.
* Looking for review of Source Code Management Best Practices [Guide](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/tree/main/docs/SCM-BestPractices)
* Chris: existing open issue.  Existing guide is OSPO-centric, and some recommendations are excessive. Options include softening recommendations or making them more generic, splitting up the guide, and/or adding “When not to use this recommendation” information. [https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/153](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/153)

<h3>Meeting Notes</h3>




* OSSF Day in Spain ([https://events.linuxfoundation.org/openssf-day-europe/](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/openssf-day-europe/))
* Secure Software Guiding Principles (SSGP)
* Guidance that SW devs will consider when developing both open source and proprietary SW (public pledge)
* Take to OSSF TAC for vote adoption
* Benefits
    * Accessible to customers
    * Easy to read English
    * Industry reputation
    * Alignment within a company
    * Competitive advantage
    * Support safe harbor claims
* [https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/212/files](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/212/files) 
    * Hasan - Could something be added about architecture as sometimes this falls short as well?
    * David - Add a phrase along the lines of “will learn” the common vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them. I.e. top CWEs ([https://cwe.mitre.org/top25/](https://cwe.mitre.org/top25/)) 
    * David - What about smaller developers contributing in their free time?
        * Initially, the goal was large companies
        * Would like feedback from individuals
    * Lots of +1s, no spoken/chat objections
    * Are there any other standards?
        * IBM Secure Engineering Framework - compatible with NIST standards
        * [https://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/redp4641.html](https://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/redp4641.html)
        * [https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/ibm-security-and-privacy-design](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/ibm-security-and-privacy-design)
        * [https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-218.pdf](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-218.pdf) 
        * [https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/ssdf](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/ssdf)
    * <span style="text-decoration:underline;">( ) Merge</span> this in as a draft to get more formal feedback. Timeline - wrapped up in the next 3 weeks (**September 1st, 2023**)
    * <span style="text-decoration:underline;">( ) CRob</span> to setup a few working sessions to work on this in real time
* GitHub discussions
    * How can we leverage this? Is this useful?
    * Categories could be helpful
    * Only have history in Slack for 90 days
        * CRob suggest posting important discussions here instead of Slack so history isn’t lost
    * Examples:
        * [https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/discussions](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/discussions)
        * [https://maintainers.github.com/](https://maintainers.github.com/)
    * David - thinks issues should go in issues, i.e. where should content go?
        * Christine - agrees could have info scattered across the digital universe
    * Chris - GitHub used to have discussions at Team levels and this went away and is now open. So visibility matches repos visibility - most likely not an issue for this group
    * Currently organized by repo for OSSF
    * Thomas - sees potential to cover discussions that are tabled from meetings and would be easier/more visible than OSSF meeting notes
    * Hasan - get notes as close as possible to the code level so think of the notes as code in order to track versions of notes
    * Should we put together usage guidelines?
        * Yes
        * Christine interested in helping
        * Turn this into a BKM (Best Known Method) to share with other groups
* [BP Issue 207](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/207) (Adoption of Sterling Toolchain/Security Toolbelt SIG)
    * Chris - only comment to sway in one group versus another but maybe put this in the Security Tooling group versus this group but unsure of actual metric how this would impact contributions
    * CRob has a conflict with the Tooling group
* Who would like to assist in crafting an MVSR for the BEST WG - [BP Issue 214](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/214)
    * Mission Vision Strategy and Roadmap
    * States the how
    * CRob needs help in creating the MVSR for this group - most of it is predefined in the readme and ( ) CRob will transfer this into the MVSR format
    * Christine, Hasan will help contribute
    * 80% Draft before the summit
    * How is this visible to the sub-groups? Do they need to contribute as well?
        * If they are producing SW then they would need at least roadmap whereas this is more of a high-level objective
    * High level goal of a MVSR for all groups but also see how they could contribute and tie together. 2 hour Zoom meeting in a couple weeks
    * One goal would be further reach of devs to share this work
* We’re moving bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org -> [www.bestpractices.dev](http://www.bestpractices.dev) - staging works, plan to do this to the “real site” soon.
    * Will redirect for a while but please switch over

    * Compiler attributes for improved security ([#201](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/201))
        * Group agrees this is useful and interesting work, but probably should be a separate doc.  Thomas will reach out to Siddesh and arranage to collab with him on this as part of our group in the near future
* Review proposed pull requests:
    * Update list of contributors ([#185](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/185)) - Initial proposal by CRob, Thomas added a few names from the GitHub history

        * Thomas will mail historic contributors to ask them if they desire to be listed
    * Mark options with performance impact in recommended options table ([#144](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/144)) - Thomas has incorporated feedback from call on 

[2023-06-21](#heading=h.7v2fwb1f50v9).
        * Group agrees with suggested change in PR with adjustment of "may not align with user expectations" => "is likely to be unacceptable to users"

<h3>New Friends</h3>




* Adrianne Marcum - TPM at LF focusing on OpenSSF

<h3>Opens</h3>




* (Seth) Intent to create a set of packaging best practices for Python developers. Likely some overlap with best practices of many ecosystems (VCS like GitHub, GitLab)
* Jeffrey borek: vis-a-vis the license…  a recent blog post about licencing recently - and relevancy of license, see: [https://www.infoworld.com/article/3703768/the-licensing-war-is-over.html](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3703768/the-licensing-war-is-over.html)
    * David: Many cans of worms - the best practices badge and scorecard says “hey is there a license” & require is. From a BP badge - my focus is more on security & sustainability. If you want something to be secure over time it needs to be sustained - in order for it to be sustained it needs to have a license. So even if you don’t care about legal risk (and you should), licenses matter for sustainment (since people are less likely to contribute to unlicensed software), and sustainment is important for long-term security. Risk. “Developers care about” - yes most developers don’t know about the law, but software engineering people often don’t learn these… a lot of developers are unaware that there are laws in the world that apply to their business. Many developers don’t know what the law requires, but that lack of knowledge doesn’t matter, laws are still important.
    * Dan: I would discount this view. Speaking as someone at a company who works with engineers that do care about licenses - and with a legal team that does care about licenses. And as someone who does have opinions about licenses… [https://www.torgo.com/blog/2023/06/whats-the-deal-with-open-source-open-data-and-open-standards-licenses.html](https://www.torgo.com/blog/2023/06/whats-the-deal-with-open-source-open-data-and-open-standards-licenses.html) 
* Seth: Python best practices … touches on source control management…  Proposing some new work…
    * Crob: I support… 
    * Similar to NPM BP Guide - [https://github.com/ossf/package-manager-best-practices/blob/main/published/npm.md](https://github.com/ossf/package-manager-best-practices/blob/main/published/npm.md) 
* Sarah: Joined to find out what the state of discussion of secure software guiding principles.
    * Will find…

<h3>Meeting Notes</h3>

<h3>Project Updates</h3>


**(please enter and speak to anything interesting)**

<h4>OpenSSF Best Practices Badge project (David A. Wheeler)</h4>




* Working to move best practices badge to bestpractices.dev (may end up being [www.bestpractices.dev](www.bestpractices.dev)).
* In principle this should be easy, but when originally developed this wasn’t the plan, & some documentation is pretty bad, so we’re finding various problems along the way.
* Put notes in “Moving best practices badge to bestpractices.dev” [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xn8U_Sp770cmp-W6qPYLy_3b0S1TozEU6Ft6UBihwy8/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xn8U_Sp770cmp-W6qPYLy_3b0S1TozEU6Ft6UBihwy8/edit) 
* If anyone has experience in such moves, happy to talk offline.
* Goal is to make “everything just work” - using Fastly CDN  so a little more complicated.

<h4>Security Fundamentals Course SIG (David A. Wheeler)</h4>




* Adding intro videos (to make it more interesting)
* Added info about caching - disabling caching when it’s sensitive information
    * Caching in browsers and intermediate
    * FYI David - you may be interested in bfcache guidelines here [https://w3ctag.github.io/bfcache-guide/](https://w3ctag.github.io/bfcache-guide/)
    * David: That is interesting, but that’s pretty new. Should we wait?

<h4>SKF project(Glenn)</h4>




* 

<h4>CRE/Inventory project(spyros)</h4>




* 

<h3>Scorecard project(Laurent - Azeem)</h3>




* Request for feedback on [roadmap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ttLH1U4BRZkgVukBltLxKyP7UmFSLIyPtUUe1G86Sv0/edit?usp=sharing)

* [https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/tree/main/docs/SCM-BestPractices](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/tree/main/docs/SCM-BestPractices) 
* Noam: basically finished - stable version - not adding new policies at the moment.
* Crob: we should send an email out for request for comments
* Dan: [https://best.openssf.org/SCM-BestPractices/](https://best.openssf.org/SCM-BestPractices/)
* Crob: happy with the state of things.
* Noam: We wanted to get the first version and then other SCMs…
* Crob: [on PR] we will “release” it at the OpenSSF Day Europe - in early september we could write a short blog post.
* Dan: itay has dropped some text here [https://openssf.slack.com/archives/C058EC1EZ5Y/p1690874915573189?thread_ts=1690460723.749409&cid=C058EC1EZ5Y](https://openssf.slack.com/archives/C058EC1EZ5Y/p1690874915573189?thread_ts=1690460723.749409&cid=C058EC1EZ5Y) 
* Draft blog post from Itay Katz (big thanks! 👏):
    * [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PaXZOd7dnGZMmhvqnvvsQ2WxhimlzClwvCq1jqsv29s/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PaXZOd7dnGZMmhvqnvvsQ2WxhimlzClwvCq1jqsv29s/edit)
        * We workshopped the above during the meeting and it’s in good shape now
* Scorecard - will point to SCM guide once we publish specific 
* David - we should map back from the badging as well.

* Is someone willing to scribe for the meeting today?
* Welcome new friends
* Call for opens (list new items below)
* WG Administrivia/bookkeeping/backlog review
* Sub-project updates (as needed)
* Issues
* [Issue 195](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/195) -   Add “developers landing page” to OpenSSF website. Page is here: [https://best.openssf.org/developers](https://best.openssf.org/developers)
    * David: I think we’re ready to declare this as beyond incubation & that we can link to it directly from OpenSSF web site.
    * Crob: good initiative… good first step.
    * All agreed to have this published on the OpenSSF website (no disagreement)
    * We need to clarify the maturity levels (sandbox, etc.) for documents
* [Issue 202 ](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/202)-  suggestions to adjust the Concise Guide to Evaluating OSS Software
    * David: a couple of words added is ok but this shouldn’t become a book…
    * 

<h3>New Friends</h3>




* 

<h3>Opens</h3>




* Sal: Improving from the [2022 Security Slam](https://www.cncf.io/reports/security-slam-north-america-2022/): Any thoughts on best practice metrics we should include/improve for the upcoming [2023 Security Slam](https://gist.github.com/eddie-knight/e97526a9ceb89143a18d60b101e69b72) (including micro-learning content)
* Discussion on fonts on the concise guides, landing page, etc… 
* Chris: I’d suggest changing the fonts to Poppins…
* David: the direction I’ve been given is that the web site will switch to this… happy to switch to a different font… @CRob talk to jbly about issue 160

<h3>Backlog Review</h3>




* 

<h3>Meeting Notes</h3>




* Landing Page
* Proposal 1: link to the landing page from the OpenSSF web site
    * _No objections noted._
* Proposal 2: figure out what label to put on it - incubation, etc…? Or do we use community specification labels for this?
    * _Still need some more discussion on this._

<h3>Project Updates</h3>


**(please enter and speak to anything interesting)**

<h4>OpenSSF Best Practices Badge project(David A. Wheeler)</h4>




* Various updates of dependencies.
* Intend to start work on switching domain name & logo soon.
* Review to see what can be acquired from Scorecard (automation)
* Need to start considering review/update of criteria if we’re to update 2024. Need to give people time to update. Comments welcome. Remove things that are no longer issues, investigate alignment with Scorecard.

<h4>Security Fundamentals Course SIG (David A. Wheeler)</h4>




* Have created video introductions for every chapter (between David A. Wheeler & CRob). These will go live within ~3 weeks. This addresses feedback that said that having just text & images was a little tedious; many learners wanted at least a little video to make it more interesting. This adds video, while still making it easy to update the contents.
* Have draft text for caching. [https://github.com/ossf/secure-sw-dev-fundamentals/pull/131](https://github.com/ossf/secure-sw-dev-fundamentals/pull/131)

<h4>SKF project(Glenn)</h4>




* Sandbox continues. They’re translating markdown into JSON. Need to talk with David.

<h4>CRE/Inventory project(spyros)</h4>

* Document set up for on the website… [Source Code Management Platform Configuration Best Practices | OpenSSF Best Practices Working Group](https://best.openssf.org/SCM-BestPractices/) - at a great URL.
    * Automatically re-generated
* What’s left to be done?
    * Christine: will **add - file a PR **about private repos…
    * Noam: github’s new feature of rulesets - it was in beta - now enforced on new repos. We need to update the doc to reflect that.
        * Can’t create the old style branch protection rules…
        * **Noam to make a proposal on what needs to change **do info…
        * Christine to see what needs to change as well…
* Dan: we might need some navigation – in the HTML doc version of the SCM guide…
* Arnaud: **to submit a PR to add publication dates**. If you see it on best.openssf.org no indication of the date…  
* Dan: I don’t think the page … link at the end is the best link … 
* Arnaud: it’s because we’re using an automated process run by github - simplest way - but no configuration options.
* Dan: Maybe add a link we manually strip in.

Agenda



* Welcome new friends
    * Andres Orbe - Alpha Omega
* Is someone willing to scribe for the meeting?
* Call for opens (list new items below)
* Review proposed pull requests on guide:
* Mark options with performance impact in recommended options table ([#144](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/144))

Thomas has added a general remark that some options may have a performance impact and providing additional details regarding performance implications in the detailed description of the options.


There is some concern that by just mentioning performance impact, some targeted adopters of these compiler options will opt to not enabling them. \
Might be useful to be up-front about performance concerns to mitigate the chances of looking a bit shady.


We may recommend to perform proper benchmarking if performance is critically important.


Solution: write a paragraph about benchmarking. Note speed, binary (stored) size, runtime memory use. 
 
Proposed paragraph:


“Many of the compiler options detailed below may have an affect on the software's performance. Engineers should evaluate any trades-offs of enabling more secure options versus observed performance test data within the context of their software's use cases. Prior to making any changes in production environments, thorough testing should be conducted to understand how the compiler hardening options affect the performance and security aspects of the software. Remember that a system that works quickly, but for an adversary, is typically not what a user wants.”

* Flag usage recommendations, order sensitivity ([#165](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/165/))

Thomas has added text outlining that distributions may use different default options.


David recommends to add a neutral statement that some options may be order-sensitive. Typically, the option provided last takes precedence over the same options provided earlier


Generalize whenever possible (GCC and clang). However, “clang -v” doesn’t do this. Also note Microsoft’s compiler.


Also add, earlier, “Note that some flags are order-sensitive; in particular, if you set the same parameter more than once, the later one typically governs all parameters after that point.”. See also: \
gcc -O2 -dM -E - < /dev/null

* Add list of considered but excluded options ([#184](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/184))
    * Everyone loved this!
    * David W: Add this sentence just before the last intro sentence (“The following table…”): “While they are not in the recommended list, you may find them useful for your purposes.”
* David W: you can see a “pretty” version of the draft here: [https://best.openssf.org/Compiler-Hardening-Guides/Compiler-Options-Hardening-Guide-for-C-and-C++](https://best.openssf.org/Compiler-Hardening-Guides/Compiler-Options-Hardening-Guide-for-C-and-C++) This is using the “Simplest Possible Process” for publication which the best practices WG is experimenting with.

* Call for opens (list new items below)
* WG Administrivia/bookkeeping/backlog review

    * Comments? Changes? Can we accept this & link to it from the OpenSSF front page? If not, what would make that okay?
    * Should it be “developer” or “developers” or “Developer” or “Developers”? (upper/lowercase, singular or plural). Propose “Developers”.
* We should be talking about tooling in SCM

Notes

Sub-project updates:

Christine - for SCM guide we didn’t meet last week so no updates today.

Nothing from memory safety…scorecard…

**W3C workshop** : Upcoming W3C “Secure the Web forward” workshop


Original date didn’t work out due to volume of submissions


Being relaunched as a virtual workshop in September


Seeking to connect the security and the web developer communities


Ex - “SBOM” does not mean much to web devs.


Brings together W3C, OSSF, OpenJS


CFP is open into July.  Need quality submissions



* [https://www.w3.org/2023/03/secure-the-web-forward/](https://www.w3.org/2023/03/secure-the-web-forward/) 

**Tooling in SCM**

Opened a TAC issue to discuss…  [https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/176](https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/176) 


Static URL… fancy presentation cleaned up … working with Jennifer to modify the CSS… branding, fonts, colors, etc…

**[TAC Issue 169](https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/169) - Maintainer experience**


Maintainer approach the TAC including several suggested solutions… overall task .. to better engage developers & maintainers … will be taken on by dev rel function in OpenSSF. If people are interested in participation, some notifications will be happening in the coming weeks.


[Landing page suggestion](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/blob/c0ad93ca98d7237f9fe6663a68ddc7acaa1380e5/docs/developer.md). Some good feedback so far. Do we see any of our work missing?


    
Christine: For “getting involved” would it be helpful to see what they’d like to look at first? Also should we have events in here? E.g. the workshop …


Crob: yes I feel we should events and things… DE&I education office hours. 


Avishay: “critical OSS projects” – maybe we should link from this to critical projects list… Will raise a PR.


[geneal good feedback]

**DE&I Office Hours**

Held 3rd office hours last week - lots of people - shaping up. Lots of repeated people attendees.

**Scorecard API PR** - [https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/pull/3107](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/pull/3107) 

Dan: this is in progress with LF legal

**Discussion on Outreach / Education**


Jeffrey: Discussion of AI & security…


Jay: Need for cross-organizational coordination on education – more info sharing needed.


Crob: need more outreach - teaching people how to make use of the technologies we have e.g. SLSA…  We need an OSS newbies class. Teaching people new to the community.


Jeffrey: we need a breakthrough news item. 

**SBOM-a-rama highlights** … quick summary is - a lot of work ongoing to turn the idea of SBOMs into reality. And making big changes industry-wide is hard. There are folks doing it right now. But lots still in progress.


Crob: a role we could help with is - making it easy for upstream maintainers to work it into their workflow. We can provide tools, education for  developers, then we go out and raise awareness. That’s our tactic with OpenVEX. Get upstream to start producing VEX so people across the supply chain can start deciding how to take action. We had the idea of a **podcast** that went into the education plan. Podcast dedicated to OSS security … supply chain security… someone could come talk about each of our topics…

Agenda

Please note new Zoom link for the call: [https://zoom-lfx.platform.linuxfoundation.org/meeting/93549139521?password=3e07c7ec-68bb-421a-9f9f-d4409f31a14a](https://zoom-lfx.platform.linuxfoundation.org/meeting/93549139521?password=3e07c7ec-68bb-421a-9f9f-d4409f31a14a)



* Welcome new friends
* Is someone willing to scribe for the meeting?
* Call for opens (list new items below)
* The meeting invites expired. We’ve re-added the meeting invitation, please let everyone know!
    * Please make sure the invite is updated in any links.
* David A. Wheeler:
    * Would like to rename directory “Compiler_Hardening_Guides” to change underscores to dashes per [https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/163](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/163)
    * This is a small step in creating good-looking web pages from the markdown, across the best practices WG. Here’s an early draft URL (domain name being discussed):
    * [https://bp.openssf.org/Compiler_Hardening_Guides/Compiler-Options-Hardening-Guide-for-C-and-C++.html](https://bp.openssf.org/Compiler_Hardening_Guides/Compiler-Options-Hardening-Guide-for-C-and-C++.html)
* Topics related to QA & co-operation around the guide:
    * On issue [#149](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/149) it was pointed out in the last meeting that the issue highlights the more broader topic of how do we ensure the quality of the guide? Should principally accept contributions as long as they fit the scope and format of the guide or should we strive to validate each submission, e.g., against reference code? (what should that be?)
    * We’re generally happy with what we have so far
    * Proposed changes need to be reviewed, accepted by general consensus, take a vote if that’s what’s needed to determine consensus.
    * If an option is more specific, perhaps put that in separate table to identify “specialized” options & explain in what cases it would be useful.
    * Our scope includes code for IoT (device makers).
    * David has created a push request
* Recently opened issues:
    * Should we be recommending options that aren't very portable? (Issue [#146](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/146), [#148](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/148))
    * Recently opened issues:
* Perhaps move some “test only” flags to their own section (so they’re not lost), e.g., assertions. We don’t want test-only flags in the production list of flags!

<h4>Opens</h4>




* 

<h4>Guide Notes</h4>




* CRob will check if the Zoom link is in the Readme. Please let Thomas know if there are other places the link should be updated to.
* David asks to rename the “Compiler_Hardening_Guides” to use dashes instead of the underscores to make links to the page more friendly for the new BEST WG web page formatting. Small demo of new web page formatting.
* Randall expressed interest in contributing to the CSS and layout of the pages.
* Thomas has created a PR for the naming change ([#166](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/166)). It was decided to merge the PR during the call.
* Continuing discussion on quality assurance started during the previous meeting. (Notes on discussion above)

Agenda



* Is someone willing to scribe for the meeting today?
* Welcome new friends
* Call for opens (list new items below)
* WG Administrivia/bookkeeping/backlog review
* Sub-project updates (as needed)
* [TAC Issue 169](https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/169) - Maintainer experience - what can we do to assist?
* We should be talking about tooling in SCM
* Question on SCM guide : what’s should be the canonical location? <- Dan
    * Home on OpenSSF, click through to GitHub
    * Is that the desired end state?
    * Follow the pattern from Concise Guides etc…
    * _discussion on the final product for this and other items like it - maybe using Jekyll to publish a prettier format on openssf.org website…_
    * Amanda: can use a github page…  Need to work on Branding in CSS.
    * David: one quirkiness is generated files should be in some directory that represents the repo…  As long as the URL is stable then it’s fine.
    * David: I think we should do this. Amanda Martin’s experimented.
    * [https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/158](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/158) 
    * David: I’ve done this on other systems.
* DEI EDU Subcommittee office hours - next up 15 June
* DevRel issues: [https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/169](https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/169)
    * Is there interest from this group?
    * Christine: Yes!
    * David: YES!
        * There are many good ideas here. A quick win would be creating the Dedicated "Landing Page" Specifically Aimed At Maintainers.
    * Dan: YES. And hopefully can get our dev rel team involved as well.
    * David: creating a dedicated landing page <- a good idea
    * Crob: in diagrammers society - we’ve discussed a persona view. Help walk these people through what they want to do…
    * Arnaud: I agree – she is telling us we’re failing in one of our main goals - we’re not making ourselves relevant. Communication geared towards member companies. So we need to take this seriously. She was nice enough to come up with suggestions,. We need to take this into account.
    * Dan: support - love the idea of a slack channel or something - this needs to be staffed up. We could use the existing slack as a way to engage maintainers.
    * Crob: we are hiring a community manager. [https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/LinuxFoundation/743999909659433-community-manager-openssf](https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/LinuxFoundation/743999909659433-community-manager-openssf)
    * This and the previous point have interrelationship - better publishing… We don’t have to wait for the hiring to do the landing page… 
    * Crob:  since we do interact with maintainers more than other groups - i spent some time working with a project - found how they executed their project landing pages. Impressive resources available. Videos, etc.. encouraging new contributions and community contribution. How can we do the same? Any suggestions?
    * Arnaud: we shouldn’t expect maintainers to join our cause … if they hear about us can they quickly find information that is usable to them… That’s the model we should have. Landing page is low hanging fruit. **Get to the OpenSSF web site and quickly find the page that gives them actionable information. **
    * Crob: we’re not looking to deputize .. but in vancouver we had developers start bp badge app process during the presentation. We need to make it simple. Maintainers want to do the right thing.
    * Christine: good way for member companies to get feedback .. we can bring it back into BP guide…
    * CRob: We at Intel are trying to integrate hundreds of projects with Scorecard.
        * David: As a quickstart, we could add those repo URLs into the list of a million projects we score weekly. It’s better to integrate “current commit” process, but that can happen incrementally.
        * Maybe that could be mentioned in the “developer landing page” (is that what we’re calling it?)
    * Randall: I want to help. 
    * 100s of projects integrated with scorecard - cheat code - scorecard folks already do analysis of xxx projects… It would still be good for repos to implement the action.
* David: I’d like to briefly return back to the “making nicer looking pages”. Here’s one proposal:
    * This WG already maintains the main results in a “docs/” subdirectory.
    * Proposal: experiment with using GitHub’s built-in mechanisms (Jekyll, etc.) to generate a tree of static HTML + CSS, and link to it via “bp.openssf.org”. That can be done quickly & I have experience doing that, we can then see if that’s what we’d like to do. The resulting pages would be served from “[https://bp.openssf.org/PATH](https://bp.openssf.org/PATH)” (giving us stable URLs) & other openssf.org pages can link to that.
    * Christine: support
    * Amanda: I support
    * _some discussion on how to do the CSS_
        * I would recommend if using the CSS from the wordpress site, that CSS should be version controlled, if not already, and both sites always use the same version so they stay in sync
        * David: CSS can include other CSS. Probably the best way to do this is to have a “main” CSS that the other CSS files include.
    * David: I’ll give this a try.
    * Arnaud: Be careful, Jekyll can become complex.
    * David: I agree! If you just modify basic configuration settings, select templates, and modify CSS, you’re fine. If you start modifying code that can be a deep problem. GitHub can run arbitrary workflows, but if we can avoid complex workflows that’d be better
* Perhaps it’d be good to mock up a landing page.
    * David: How about “docs/developers.md” as “landing page for developers”. We can mock up a first draft.
* Dan Appelquist: Scorecard4Purl <- new tool! (dan). Takes a package URL (pURL) as a parameter, uses GitHub & Scorecard API to produce information on that pURL.
    * [https://github.com/torgo/Scorecard4Purl](https://github.com/torgo/Scorecard4Purl) 
    * Awesome!
    * Scorecard -\-ECOSYSTEM_NAME package can do something similar (adding NuGet) - willing to add a “-\-purl PURL” option?
    * Laurant/Azeem in Scorecard team is interested in improvements, contact them via Slack
    * [https://github.com/ossf/scorecard#using-a-package-manager](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard#using-a-package-manager)
    * It’s not a command line tool, but there’s some similar information available at [https://deps.dev/](https://deps.dev/) & metrics.openssf.org

Agenda



* Feedback that we’ve received - discussing feedback from end users’ group
    * Feedback from the … group … folks love the best practices guides but sometimes don’t like them – concerned with drift.
    * They have some policy applied and someone reverts – they don’t have a way to check …
    * Noam: this is what legitify solves… run the tool in a periodic manner.
    * Interested in the framing around why it’s important and enforcing those policies - advice for tooling. Mentioned some gaps that might exist in github…
    * Notes from Slack on TODO Group (Open Source Program Office feedback)
        * Some recommendations that target corporate-controlled organizations (member SSO) may not be appropriate for community projects
        * The guide would be more useful if it was framed around how the policy could be maintained. Without enforcement, policies can get stale, so recommendations around tooling, ex: safe-settings is important. The gap here is that SCMs don't provide out-of-the-box features for policy as code to help with this.
        * OpenSSF should drive collaboration to share use cases and scenarios. This would be the next step after best practices guides which is where similar efforts begin (as an example, license compliance efforts have moved beyond guides to examples).
        * Different orgs might have different security set-ups… a case study - 
            * main area vs. labs area
        * Having more examples… use cases and scenarios… 
            * When license compliance was kicking off a lot of best practices shared… now people sharing data… sharing opinionated data…  Use cases, case studies…
            * In the roadmap for the future.. 
            * GitHub Discussions… ?
            * Case studies as well….
    * From End User wg - good feedback…
        * Relationship with SLSA
        * Noam: these documents - a framework - this document checks many of the requirements for the source code part. E..g they require code review; they require SSO for users; etc… many points that we meet.
        * Christine: in Vancouver I spoke about how it’s related to SLSA…
        * Also some feedback
    * Avishay : presented at MS and got questions about scalability of some of the rules - 
        * Difference between orgs with many open source maintainers / etc…
            * E.g. not allowing people to create public repos… hard to scale some projects without allowing those.
            * 
    * Dan: maybe make it clearer that legitify …   add to the frontmatter of the document… as well as scorecard… running audits periodically  
        * Need for tools…
        * SCMs don’t provide out of the box…
* We need to make it more clear that these are best practices and some of them might not apply … 
    * Tag enterprise policies as only applicable to “closed source” orgs…
    * Add “**how should people read the document**” material… to take a stab.
    * Maybe some material on “how to take your private stuff public” 
        * Christine: yes also 
    * This doc is broader than the open source community…
* Links in the docs
* Thoughts on things that could be added to the doc:
    * Tooling Part
        * **Noam to take a stab at the tooling.**
    * Going Public - moving from private to public
        * Sometimes repos get transferred…
        * **Christine to see if she can make a PR**
    * How to read this document
        * **Dan to do a PR on how to read this document**
    * More in-depth case studies… (maybe not ready for that yet)
    * Start a community / how to contribute (discussions) - can raise on the next best practices call. Dan to propose of GitHub Discussions.
    * What should be the stable URL for the SCM guide
        * **Dan to bring up at BP Call** <- use something like github pages?
    * New issue: [Add Azure DevOps to SCM Best Practices · Issue #155 · ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers (github.com)](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/155)
        * How to address?
        * Should it be added to legitify?
        * Noam: for now we can add it to markdown… keep same structure… if policies added to the document earlier we will add it internally…
        * Chris: What are the acceptance criteria for SCM services?
        * Dan: feels like we should have rough consensus of this group and the Best Practices group… 
            * Avishay: also impact on open source supply chain. OSSF intention is to increase the level of security in open source software… One metric could be “does it allow for open source projects”?
            * Chris: tooling should be friendly to open source projects…
        * Noam: I think we should freeze addition of SCMs and get to “1.0” before we add new SCMs.
            * _general agreement_
            * Christine: we need criteria for future roadmap…

Agenda



* Is someone willing to scribe for the meeting today?
* Welcome new friends
* Andres
* Note: CRob is on PTO today
* Call for opens (list new items below)
* WG Administrivia/bookkeeping/backlog review
* Sub-project updates (as needed)
* [Jonathan] The Great Repository Audit, which is proposed effort outside this group.
* Proposed SIG under “Securing repositories” WG, may be funded by Alpha-Omega.
* Major artifact servers (PyPI, Maven Central, RubyGems, etc.) often haven’t had pen tests. Often pen tests are performed when someone acquires your organization, but since they’re provided for free, there’s been no economic pressure to perform a pen test on them. “We may be running before we walk”.
* Note: Premise isn’t always right, many projects _do_ have pen tests performed on them. But these projects aren’t necessarily evaluated from a security POV, if they haven’t then let’s do it.
* Frankly, most proprietary software & services also haven’t undergone a pen test, security audit, or similar. It’s something that doesn’t happen often. So let’s address this.
* A SIG meeting has been added, every Thursday 9am ET (unless securing repo WG is ongoing).
* Idea: OpenSSF funds pen tests of major artifact servers.
* [https://openssf.slack.com/files/U01LYFRTSQ7/F0595TSF2TA/the_great_artifact_repository_audit](https://openssf.slack.com/files/U01LYFRTSQ7/F0595TSF2TA/the_great_artifact_repository_audit)

* [Amanda] Consolidating info into a “single repo of truth” [https://github.com/ossf/community](https://github.com/ossf/community)

Agenda



* Welcome new friends
* Is someone willing to scribe for the meeting?
* Call for opens (list new items below)
* Topics related to co-operation around the guide:
    * We are getting more contributions from outside the regular attendees to the calls. Should we try to formalize some ways of working and how to contribute instructions?

        Some topics brought up in the past: 

    * Should we tag stabilized versions of the guide periodically? (suggestion by Randall [2023-03-29](#bookmark=kix.wzcbtr1fq7ck))
    * Style and implementation of citations (continue discussion from [2023-04-12](#bookmark=kix.wzcbtr1fq7ck))
* Recently opened issues:
    * Microsoft C/C++ compiler and linker options are not covered by the hardening guide ([#150](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/150)) 
    * Compiler Options Hardening Guide for C and C++, -z nodump ([#146](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/146))
    * Compiler Hardening Guide: -Wl,-z,noexecheap command-line option ([#148](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/148))

_“[...] should be recommending options that aren't very portable? At the very least, we should be more specific about where this is supported. Binutils isn't very helpful since 50% of the linkers don't work.”_

* Compiler Options: GCC 13.1 analyzer options ([#147](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/147))
* Compiler Options Hardening Guide for C and C++, -D_LIBCPP_ASSERT ([#149](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/149))

* Review proposed pull requests on guide:
* Mark options with performance impact in recommended options table ([#144](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/144))
* Various updates by [Robert C. Seacord](https://github.com/rcseacord) ([#145](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/145))
* Minor: Fix incorrect level in _FORTIFY_SOURCE mode of operation description ([#143](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/143)) (also fixed in [#145](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/145)) ~~merged~~
* Next steps

<h4>Opens</h4>




* 

<h4>Guide Notes</h4>




* Thomas suggested spending some time on discussing ways of working: whether we should tag stable releases
    * Randall suggested tagging specific versions in the Github repository
    * Georg noted that having some sort of releases allows writing blog posts to make both developers and compiler community aware of the guide and can also reported towards the TAC 
    * Siddhesh suggested loosely tieing stable guideline releases to compiler releases to the compiler release cadence, e.g., having releases December / June would allow time to incorporate changes after GCC / LLVM releases.
    * We have a few big “feature” packages, e.g. merging old guide from Google Doc, the contributions from Microsoft and Intel which would make sense to finalize before an initial “big” release.
* Avishay asked whether the initial submissions from Microsoft should be as complete as the initial contribution from Ericsson or whether it can proceed more iteratively. 
    * No opposition to proceeding iteratively and bringing changes up for discussion in the bi-weekly calls as content becomes available for review.
* Thomas will make a suggestion on guidance for citation style that can be discussed in a future meeting.
    * Siddhart referred to [https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security_Features_Matrix](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security_Features_Matrix) as a suggestion for how to structure information.
* On issues [#146](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/146) and [#148](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/148): 
    * Siddhesh noted that 50% probably refers to GNU Binutls ld / gold and that gold is deprecated, but the comment is probably valid with regards to LLD.
    * Gabriel noted we want to be more precise when attributing options to any tool, including linker.
    * Siddhesh volunteered to improve the references to specific linker versions and possibly add a note on the deprecation on gold deprecation
* On issue [#149](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/149) Gabriel pointed that the issue highlights the more broader topic of how do we ensure the quality of the guide? Should principally accept contributions as long as they fit the scope and format of the guide or should we strive to validate each submission, e.g., against reference code? (what should that be?)   
    * It was agreed to continue this discussion in the next meeting.

Agenda



* Welcome new friends
* Is someone willing to scribe for the meeting?
* Call for opens (list new items below)
* Microsoft SDL C++ hardening guide (Michael Fanning, Gabriel Dos Reis)
* Review proposed pull requests on guide: [https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pulls](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pulls)
    * gcc -v section ([#132](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/132)) - addressing feedback from previous discussion ([ran-dall/wg-best-practices-os-developers #1](https://github.com/ran-dall/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/1))
    * Add -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks ([#139](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/139)) -  continue discussion on adding third table: "options that reduce the impact of a vulnerability, but also hide problems, it'd be better to fix the problem" (may need better wording..)

The items on the agenda beyond this point where postponed until the next meeting:



* Mark options with performance impact in recommended options table ([#144](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/144))

<h4>Guide Notes</h4>




* Thomas tried to address the feedback to [#132](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/132) in [ran-dall/wg-best-practices-os-developers #1](https://github.com/ran-dall/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/1). Discussion on this to continue offline.
* Gabriel presented the Microsoft SDL C++ hardening guide which offers broader advice on C++ software security
    * In terms of compiler flags, the guide recommends C++ Core Guideline’s Support Library (GSL) and static checkers in favor specifying compiler hardening options explicitly but there the guide covers compiler features, such as stack corruption prevention, code flow integrity such as shadow stack etc.
    * Also recommends specific C++ data types, e.g., secure versions std::vector and std::string - Covers only C++, advice on C development outside of scope
    * David likes the idea of a separate document for guidelines for the Microsoft compiler. Trying to merge the clang+gcc material AND the Microsoft material into a single table wouldn’t make sense, as the syntax and meanings of the options are very different. He’s also wondering whether compiler-independent guidance of libraries should be independent, as that is common to C++ development regardless of compiler.
    * Overall consensus seems to be to have a separate section and table for the Microsoft compiler, where specific options can be linked to the equivalent options in GCC and Clang. That will make it easy for users who just want to see the options to enable for the various compilers, _and_ simply the ability to cross-link when that’s sensible. Gabriel and Michael will come back with a proposal.
* Continuing discussion on -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks. 
    * The option will require the compiler to generate the null-check, but a null-pointer dereference can potentially be seen by the optimizer before -> a deference can still occur, but the option can reduce the impact of vulnerabilities. However, the specific contexts where the option is important are potentially narrow, e.g., OS kernel development, or during testing for null pointer conditions.
        * David disagreed: ALL programs, kernel and application, have the potential to have null dereferences when the language permits them. It’s not even limited to C/C++. He joked, “the primary purpose of a Java compiler is to generate code that raises null dereference exceptions.” It’s not an application vs. kernel difference, it’s something else.
    * The ensuing discussion seemed to suggest there would be a need to address the importance of specific functions from an _operational point of view_, and the _point of view of debug and fuzz testing_.
        * In operations, you want to minimize the risks (likelihood & impact) of vulnerabilities. So you want to minimize the impact of an error. When doing traditional functional _testing_ you want the software to be as similar as possible as the software that will be used in operations, so in functional testing you want to use the operational parameters.
        * When doing debugging & fuzz testing, you want to _maximize_ the chance that a mistake reveals itself (e.g., crash when anything isn’t right), to increase the likelihood of detection of vulnerabilities/problems before shipping. In these cases you do _not_ want the software to hide problems, but instead maximize the probability of detection.
    * Specific types of testing, e.g., fuzzing, can have further considerations, e.g. during fuzzing you want to ensure dangerous behavior is triggered on as often as possible, and consequently want to avoid options which potentially hide specific unsafe conditions.
    * From the point of view of the guide, we should also consider the priority of different options for the reader, i.e., make it clear which options are most important to avoid overwhelming the reader with a large number of options to implement and test.
    * Based on the discussion, Thomas will make a proposal to restructure the current “Recommended Options” to separate tables focused on operations vs. fuzz testing needs specifically.
* Next meeting overlaps Open Source Summit. Perhaps should cancel & re-meet in 4 weeks.

<h3>Project Updates</h3>


**(please enter and speak to anything interesting)**

<h4>OpenSSF Best Practices Badge project (David A. Wheeler)</h4>




* Big update, completed the upgrade from Rails 6->7 as the underlying framework on 2022-04-13. A big thanks to Andrew Fader.
* This was complicated because we use the gem (library) 'attr_encrypted' which was incompatible with Rails 7 (which adds its own encryption system). We worked with the library developers so we could use it with Rails 7 (so we could transition to Rails 7 first), and we now plan to switch to Rails 7’s encryption system (now that we’re using Rails 7).

<h4>Security Fundamentals Course SIG (David A. Wheeler)</h4>




* Adding a small item about password storage / KDFs about using a secure configuration (like minimum number of iterations) by linking to an OWASP page on this. This was inspired by the problems of LastPass & recent LUKS concerns  <https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/66429.html>
* As always, if you have changes, please propose!
* Looking for stories (“STORY TIME”)  - things that illustrate specific issues…  That show how these things affect people in the real world & can be made clearly/succinctly. 

<h4>SKF project(Glenn)</h4>

* Is someone willing to scribe for the meeting?
* Call for opens (list new items below)
* Review existing guide

    * Issue [119 ](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/119)- distros compiler options 
* Review proposed pull requests on guide: [https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pulls](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pulls)
    * __GLIBCXX_ASSERTIONS ([#128](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/128))  / Precondition checks for C++ standard library calls([#142](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/142)) - New changes to review
    * gcc -v section ([#132](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/132)) - Add recommendation to explicitly enable hardening flags on the command line, rather than relying on the default profile or distro default?
    * Citations to documents calling for hardening ([#136](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/136/)) - comments?
    * Add -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks ([#139](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/139)) -  thoughts about adding this? This is being used by the Linux kernel to counter vulnerabilities that have already happened.

<h4>Guide Notes</h4>




* Precondition checks for C++ standard library calls([#142](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/142))
    * As those features are primarily dependent on the underlying standard library and not the compiler, Thomas added references to clarify version dependencies on libc++ and libstdc++
    * CRob and David emphasize that performance impacts should be considered and described in the document
    * Siddhesh: performance impacts may be very workload specific and only noticeable in specific circumstances. We shouldn't create the misconception of significant impacts which would cause developers to not use these options. The security benefits likely outweigh the performance impacts.
    * Proposal: indicate in the overview table which options have a noteworthy performance impact and add more details in the dedicated performance impact section
* gcc -v section ([#132](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/132))
    * In previous discussions it was concluded that duplicate flags due to defaults enabled by distributions is not harmful
    * Jack: ordering of flags can have an impact on the output. Which options take precedence?
    * Thomas will add corresponding text to the PR
* Citations to documents calling for hardening ([#136](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/136/))
    * The intention is to point to supplementary documents and underline the importance of this work
    * CRob proposes to use in-text links
    * Agreement to have a dedicated discussion about the style and implementation of citations
* Add -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks ([#139](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/139))
    * David has added text on options which have been added to disable optimizations which can result in vulnerabilities in specific code bases (e.g., the kernel).
    * There are more flags like this and we should investigate those individually and add those to the document accordingly
    * Discussions to be continued
    * Siddhesh: a difference between options like buffer checks and this option here is that the latter allows the execution to continue and thereby it may cover issues. Buffer checks instead terminate the program and clearly point to a problem.

* Dan presents ideas..
* Action: can we get the script checked into the directory?
* Crob likes it.
* How do we best auto-generate the lists in the 3 readme files?
    * Including stripping in the editorial info?
    * And the “operations” guide type info?
* Dan to make PR - and CROB to merge it…
* Crob: When should we talk about this?
* Christine: put a talk proposal into OSS NA … and it’s beeh accepted.
    * We agreed to try to get it in as good a state as possible by then.
* Maybe add some editorial around 2fa to make it clear they’re going to need to do it…

* _FORTIFY_SOURCE=3 (PR [#133](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/133)) changes look good to be merged 
* Discussion on gcc -v section (PR [#132](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/132))
    * Siddhesh noted that it can be difficult for a user to tell which flags are relevant and may up the possibility for “inconsistent usage” where, based on output of gcc -v, users may assume some options are enabled by default 
    * Sam noted that gcc -v may not help with portability issues
    * It was suggested to keep the currently proposed text in the place proposed in the PR, but add an explicit recommendation to explicitly enable hardening flags on the command line, rather than relying on the default profile or distro default
    * Saddhesh proposed having an appendix focusing on configuring default profiles in GCC
    * Randall offered to work on such an appendix
* Discussion around __GLIBCXX_ASSERTION (PR [#128](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/128)) and whether it would make sense to recommend filing upstream bugs of builds failing with __GLIBCXX_ASSERTION towards C++ project + whether it makes sense to have a general recommendation to report issues with hardening options upstream
    * Concerns were raised around whether such as stance could prove contentious and making a call for specific options would require making a call option-by-option, e.g., _FORTIFY_SOURCE=3 has issues with specific C language features projects may decide to use, whereas __GLIBCXX_ASSERTION usually indicates problems in user code due to invalidated pre-conditions
    * On status of PR it was suggested to incorporate LLVM libc++ `_LIBCPP_ASSERT ` into the same section, but keep options separate in the recommended options table stating one is specific for GCC libstdc++ and the other for LLVM libc++. Thomas volunteered to propose corresponding additions to the original PR.
* Randall suggested that, process-wise, it would be a good idea to tag stabilized versions of the guide periodically. Due to running out of time it was decided to bring this up on the agenda in a future meeting for more discussion.

<h3>Opens</h3>




* URL Parsers - Jonathan Leitschuh
    * There are 2 standards for parsing URLs: RFC spec + WHATWG spec (living document)
    * If you’re using a URL parser, and the thing doing the resolving is different, you can allowlist domains that resolve to something else. There was a BlackHat presentation on this topic, re: GitHub filtering. Many PHP programs will call PHP’s parser, but then call curl (which does parsing differently). Curl implements the RFC spec.
    * [https://github.com/akr3ch/BugBountyBooks/blob/main/The%20tangled%20Web_%20a%20guide%20to%20securing%20modern%20Web%20applications%20(%20PDFDrive%20).pdf](https://github.com/akr3ch/BugBountyBooks/blob/main/The%20tangled%20Web_%20a%20guide%20to%20securing%20modern%20Web%20applications%20(%20PDFDrive%20).pdf)
    * The W3C TAG might want to get involved, Dan Appelquist co-chairs. That connects RFC, WHATWG, etc. Dan A. is happy to help. [https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/)
    * It’s more complex. There are URLs, URIs, IRIs, etc.
    * Focus on _threats_ - so we can fix it.
    * [https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2016/05/11/my-url-isnt-your-url/](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2016/05/11/my-url-isnt-your-url/)
    * [https://hackerone.com/reports/704621](https://hackerone.com/reports/704621)
    * Jonathan will tell us where the discussion will take place, to help id threats.
    * https://www.techrepublic.com/article/url-parsing-a-ticking-time-bomb-of-security-exploits/
* Scorecard discussion - Dan A.
    * Want to add more information from Scorecards (what’s wrong, how to fix, etc.) - probably should coordinate, so the text is the same.
    * Legitify is doing similar things.
* MS contribution to the C/C++ hardening guide (WIP)
    * The current plan is to make the MS guide separate from gcc/clang/Intel. The latter all share the same option syntax, option names for the same thing, etc. (e.g., “-” prefix for option). The MS compilers takes  different syntax & use different names, so it’s clearer to have that as a separate document (with cross-links).

    * Issue [119 ](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/119)- distros compiler options 
* Next steps

<h4>Opens</h4>




* 

<h4>Guide Notes</h4>




* Support for other compilers
    * Friends from Intel and Microsoft are joining in to complement the guide with options targeting the Intel and Microsoft compilers
* Repository permissions
    * CRob is working with LF staff to clean up and correctly set up the permissions
* Default gcc profile
    * Randall: GCC has a default profile which enables some of the recommended options if no options are specified specifically.
    * The default options may differ across distributions
    * Some options are considered "default" by the majority of distros and Linux ecosystem. Not compiling when using some of those options is even considered a bug by some.
* Siddhesh: FORTIFY_SOURCE=3 is being pushed for adoption by various distributions (e.g., Fedora). FORTIFY_SOURCE has impacts on specific language structures (e.g., flex arrays) and therefore some popular applications disable FORTIFY_SOURCE (e.g., vim).
* David: there are at least three classes of users
    * Linux distributions: this guide is probably not targeting the distribution maintainers because they already have a very good understanding of these options
    * Open source applications: we want these flags to get adopted by developers
    * Distributors / Vendors (in particular of IoT devices)
* Thomas:
    * supported versions: we should aim for covering the latest and greatest and explicitly show since which version of a compiler an option is supported.
* David: recommends to provide the latest and greatest flags and describe in the details why certain options may not be usable by specific compiler versions
* Gabriel: should we cover language constructs which may require special considerations in the context of some options?
    * This document is primarily about options, less about language construct. However, it is valuable to refer to best practices in the context of specific options.
* Discussion about enabling -O1 or -O2 when using FORTIFY_SOURCE to make it most useful.
* Randall: do we want to open bug reports in upstream projects when they don't compile when using specific options and point to this guide as a reference?
* Siddhesh: during the development of FORTIFY_SOURCE=3, the compiler devs did file bugs upstream and it generally was well received because most issues were caused by bad programming practices.

<h3>Meeting Notes</h3>




* GB-TAC governance committee - education sig and oss cert sig mobilization plans under review. Feedback pending…
* New SIG for memory safety in BP wg. [Nell presents slides] 
“Reduce memory safety vulnerabilities in OSS software” 
Initial goals update language of mobilization plan, identify specific initiatives… e.g. in Rust foundation… C++, Go, initiatives… 
    * Jay - interested; Christine - interested.
    * Any synergies with C/C++ SIG? - yes 
    * Research on overlap between memory safety and security vulnerabilities - yes will send.
    * Issue to be created [in the repo]. Anyone in the sig eligible to vote.
* Vendored dependencies… [JL]
    * Crob: not in love with the term “vendored.”  - though like the idea and think the guidance is useful.
    * Dan: agree it’s difficult for some OSS maintainers
    * David/Jonathan: it’s a “term of art.”
    * David: “Vendoring” 
    * Arno: if we put wording about this in BP doc then we should make it clear when people should do it.
    * Jay: Can’t be siloed - there are frameworks across the OpenSSF that could benefit… “3rd party binaries” maybe a better term…  Should be communicated to other efforts in OpenSSF as well.
    * JL: (proposes) starting it in the guide, establishing it as a _best practice_, then communicating out from there.
    * **JL to open a PR**.

* Overview GitHub SCM Guide from F5:
    * [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DNJ6RszprzVuQKpYCRS6nj8j-XqcHk0Ss1w1itGbarI/edit#](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DNJ6RszprzVuQKpYCRS6nj8j-XqcHk0Ss1w1itGbarI/edit#) 
* Next steps

<h4>Opens</h4>

<h4>Guide Notes</h4>




* Doc was rearranged and applied to markdown. The reformatting can now spark conversations on how to organize content, ex: having an introductory question
    * Created a “Hygiene Factor” for Scorecard and moved it to the end.
    * The new structure now has labels to state applicability to GitHub and/or GitLab.
    * There then needs to be applicability for each SCM.
    * Question: can the markdown generator be set up to output a structure similar to Dan’s formatting.
        * Noam, can be done. Tried to match configuration to GitHub/GitLab and the consumer.
        * The guide could be split in two or three parts - one that’s for common information and two that are GitLab or GitHub specific.
        * Do you think there may be people using both?

            Some might be - if they are managing legacy repos or migrating…

* Doc Christine shared…
    * Intended to align within F5.
    * Some confusion between github orgs and internal orgs…
    * Structured with “Operations” “OSPO” and “Project Maintainers” as Audiences.
    * Guidelines organized into repos -
        * Orgs
        * Repos	
        * Operations
    * Some intro text for each section… 
    * “Managing roles and access”
        * “Only company employees” <- it’s important if you’re a company / entity 
        * Dan: might map onto collaborators vs. external contributors
        * Process of how things become public…
            * Limit who can make repos public?
        * 2fa 
        * Inactive members and ex-employees
        * Downgrading global admin / ownerpriv for members with no activity…
    * Organizing Repos
        * Where should projects be put <- might not be relevant 
            * Make sure your orgs make sense
        * Private repos lasting longer than 6 months….
        * [should we have private repos related best practices?]
    * Repositories
        * Use “Security Scanning Tool”
    * Managing Roles & Access
        * Use teams - kinds of teams - maintain teams…
    * Project Setup & Support
        * E.g. scorecard… 
    * Operations
        * For the folks going to be operating things - turning on github insights, audit log, review security…
        * Using internal tool with advance token permission to automate tasks…
        * Different UI for maintainers…
        * Automated alerts & tools…
    * Process
        * Setting up a new github org, a new github repo…
        * Archiving a github repo… 
        * Approving 3rd party github apps…
* Discussion on best practices around teams… use of teams.
* Current thinking is to have separate GitHub and GitLab docs / markdown generated from Legitify data and have an overview (front matter) listing common best principles.
* Regenerating the markdown with specific anchors will make it easier to link to. This happens by default so should not be an issue.
* Action item:
    * Take the [GitHub Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DNJ6RszprzVuQKpYCRS6nj8j-XqcHk0Ss1w1itGbarI/edit#heading=h.35nkun2) and adapt that into the front matter to show how it could look linking to GitHub best practices.

Meeting Notes



* Welcome new friends
    * No new friends today
* Is anyone interested in co-leading this project?
    * Thomas volunteered to co-lead this activity. No objections from the group.
* Review existing guide
    * [https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/blob/main/docs/Compiler_Hardening_Guides/Compiler-Options-Hardening-Guide-for-C-and-C%2B%2B.md](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/blob/main/docs/Compiler_Hardening_Guides/Compiler-Options-Hardening-Guide-for-C-and-C%2B%2B.md) 
    * Name of the document
        * David: the document should include the term "options"
        * The suggestion is valid. Thomas has already updated the draft. Current title: "Compiler Options Hardening Guide for C and C++"
    * Handling of other compilers
        * The Microsoft compiler is widely used, but different options
        * The Intel compiler is closer to gcc and clang, but there are differences nevertheless
        * Proposal: we'll focus on gcc and clang and aim for including compilers which using similar options (Intel, AMD) in a separate section of the same document. Other compilers using significantly other options (Microsoft) will be covered in a separate document.
    * Should we consider options specifically for or impacting encryption?
        * No objections, but this will probably added later
        * Depending on the content, this could be handled as an appendix
    * Navigability (Findability)
        * Add named links for details for each flag, so you can jump straight to it. <span id=”-fstack-clash-protection”></span>. That will create some ugliness in the markdown. That enables everyone to link to specifics.
        * GitHub markdown ids already work, they do change when header names
        * General idea: provide a one-sentence description of each option and link to a detailed description further down in the document.
        * David: I’ll mock up one hyperlink + anchor
    * Default configuration options per distro
        * Randall will share information about which options are enabled by default by selected distributions
* Next steps
    * Review for content - issue?
    * Review older doc, see what can be extracted
    * Randal will grab distro flag lists & share with group
    * Randal will fix the markdown formatting (in this case, markdownlint)
    * CRob reach out to Avishay to find MSFT compiler folks to contribute
    * CRob get Diana Carroll @ Intel to contribute icc flags
    * CRob lookup AMD OSSF contact and see if they are interested in contributing amd compiler options

Agenda



* Welcome new friends
* Is someone willing to scribe for the meeting?
* Upcoming TAC elections:
* **Voter Eligibility (Electorate) Self-Nomination Process**
    * Any contributor to OpenSSF working groups or initiatives is eligible to participate in the election. Valid contributions include: commits or submitted pull requests via Github; public edits or comments on Google docs or other work products associated with OpenSSF; posting messages to any mailing list or on Slack; and beyond that any other form of positive engagement with OpenSSF activities. The form asks you for an example of your contributions; this is merely to make it easier for election observers and OpenSSF staff to validate. If you have in any way been involved in or care about OpenSSF, but are in doubt as to whether your contribution “counts”, please fill it out anyways, and we will follow up.
    * Deadline: March 12, 2023
    * [Voter Eligibility Self-Nomination Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdgQdwnRH5nMLkYUDhuM7LYxUynairprGc_xAPIZm9SGaytfg/viewform?usp=sf_link)
* **TAC Self-Nomination Process**
    * The OpenSSF Technical Advisory Council (TAC) is composed of seven total individuals, four of whom are elected annually. If you are interested in serving on the TAC, and qualify as an eligible voter as above, please complete the self-nomination form below,
    * Deadline: March 12, 2023
    * [TAC Candidate Self-Nomination Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdn91eLxfVYwiDw4OrAw3lSYVPVqOkcTJl2VzX07Q7idONefQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) 
* **SCIR Self-Nomination Information and Process**
    * [Since early in its existence](https://openssf.org/blog/2020/10/07/openssf-seeks-security-community-individual-representative-for-governing-board/), the OpenSSF Governing Board has sought to ensure it gets adequate input from voices in the software security community who would otherwise not be at the table. We seek candidates for the Security Community Individual Representative (SCIR) who can represent those voices, while also being a subject matter expert in the field with their own set of perspectives. Familiarity with the different OpenSSF working groups and projects, and being able to dedicate the time to be sufficiently informed on the issues that arise in our monthly calls and ongoing discussions, is highly desired. It is also highly desired, but not required, that the SCIR be a contributor and thus eligible to vote in the election. 
    * Deadline: March 12, 2022
    * [SCIR Candidate Self-Nomination Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfsbVO1wMfEXZNJmYqjm2ND929HHYgwGrNu-uRifV5xwszLCw/viewform?usp=sf_link)
* **2023 Election Process**

The Election Process will be monitored by Election Officials (volunteers identified by the TAC). At the conclusion of the validation period, Election Officials will publish the complete list of candidates.

* Begin of overall election process: February 27
* TAC Self-Nomination Period: February 27 - March 12 (2 weeks)
* SCIR Self-Nomination Period: February 27 - March 12 (2 weeks)
* Voter Ballot Request Period: February 27 - March 12 (2 weeks)
* Validation Period: March 13 - March 19 (1 week)

* C/C++ Compiler Options BP Guide discussion
    * Initial PR for Ericsson contribution. Accept & then fix markdown & then start adding other material? [https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/113](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/113)
* David: Accept this change to a concise guide for evaluation? Basically, “evaluations might not be done by you” - they might be done by someone you hire or someone else.
    * [https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/115](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/115)
    * You can see the results here: [https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/blob/08f3f14cdd967e4693c532794c52c0b020b47149/docs/Concise-Guide-for-Evaluating-Open-Source-Software.md](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/blob/08f3f14cdd967e4693c532794c52c0b020b47149/docs/Concise-Guide-for-Evaluating-Open-Source-Software.md)
    * Should we just remove dates from the top heading?
* Update on SCM BP Guide
* Current guide being worked on here: [https://cryptpad.w3ctag.org/code/#/2/code/view/+VgHY4qyh2l+TjbgorwK+Up7Vgjvqz4cSctfjsYfXlw/](https://cryptpad.w3ctag.org/code/#/2/code/view/+VgHY4qyh2l+TjbgorwK+Up7Vgjvqz4cSctfjsYfXlw/) (Read-only version)
    * Severities are a heuristic estimate.
    * In the longer term we should crosswalk with Scorecards. Include the Scorecards measures here, and provide a list to Scorecards of what’s missing (maybe they’d add them)

* CfP for OpenSSF day in May in Vancouver,. … Closes March 17.
* Town Hall - Christine & Jay to present on DE&I subcommittee… status update. Alpha & Omega update. SBOMs everywhere update. 
* David: Concise guide updates .. tweaks to ensure we make it clear evaluation can be done or done for you… 
* **PR merged **[https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/115/files](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/pull/115/files) 
* Scorecards work is going well.
* Some Linux distros are discussing snaps, flatpak, etc. “Next gen packaging”. They all include a bunch of things. There’s little regard on dependencies, they’re all inside, so vulnerabilities can be embedded & thus need to be constant re-issued.
* Jonathan: Best practices for maintainers - CVE issuance… disclosure of vulnerabilities in **software that you vendor**.   Updating transitive dependencies. 
    * Issue [114 ](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/114) 
    * [discussion on CVE lifecycle]
* Randall: next gen packaging - linux community. Lot of investment… talk about how the operate… operating with no oversight. Could be a problem.
    * Maybe invite Alex Larsen (Red Hat)

<h3>Project Updates</h3>


**(please enter and speak to anything interesting)**

<h4>OpenSSF Best Practices Badge (David A. Wheeler)</h4>




* Rails 7 update in progress.

<h4>Security Fundamentals Course (David A. Wheeler)</h4>




* Is HTML a target=(non-_self) still a problem? Please tell us! [https://github.com/ossf/secure-sw-dev-fundamentals/pull/108](https://github.com/ossf/secure-sw-dev-fundamentals/pull/108)
    * David: interesting discussion - if you add an <a> tag with certain characteristics it can lead to a vulnerability. The PR - browsers have made some changes and had to counter this problem. So is this is a historical problem?
    * Dan Appelquist will investigate.
    * Glenn Ten Cate: Tabnabbing. Yes it’s an issue from the past but not everyone uses latest version of browser… Older browsers would also have lots of other security issues.
    * David: old security vulnerabilities in browsers are not news. If it’s no longer relevant then I’ll cut the material.
    * Ixchel: If you don’t have the chance to update your machine then it’s relevant… 
    * David: it used to be a problem… 
    * Crob: feedback to PR108… Dan to talk to some web browser community contacts.
* Glen: what about cross site request forgery protection… Browsers also protect against this.
    * David: this is addressed already… same-site cookies which are the default.
* David: course talks briefly about side-channel attacks - timing attacks and cache attacks - it notes the existence of that. “Hey these kind of attacks exist. When selecting crypto systems take this into account.” Audience is a general app developer one.

* Next call on the 9th. Noam has good content we’re using as baseline… 
* Dan: reorganizing points.
* Christine: think about the personas - e.g. dealing with a lot of repos like the repo maintainer. Also reorganizing some of the content around operations… 
* Q: where to the scores come from
    * Noam: came from our product… still needs to be discussed within the group.
    * Christine: On severity - related to scorecards too

* Internal (GitHub) SCM document update from Christine

<h3>Meeting Notes</h3>




* Dan shared his cryptpad combination of the current work from Noam.
    * Started to arrange to arrange things into categories
* Noam’s table seems to be doing similar things, aligning GH & GL options
* Members of an organization vs people who belong to a repository…
    * In a repo - people organized around teams… policies about who can be a member of the organization and who can add members…
* Up-level a bit and talk about repository access controls - and group management.
* Other systems beyond GitHub and GitLab…
* “Best Practices” vs. “Other recommendations”
* Christine to share a “generic” version of the document they have come up with in F5…
* David: any covered by scorecoards? We can have a marker in the document to indicate if there is a scorecard entry.
    * Presence of a license…
* Roy: the **repo best practices** is aligned well but there are also other asset types - like the organization, server, etc… 
* David: if something is detected by scorecards… or best practices badge… especially look for things that aren’t covered elsewhere.
* “OSSF scorecard should be above 7”
* David: work going on in Scorecard - eg. gitlab, ci systems, … 
* Dan: scorecard icon in the document where it makes sense - and a link to the documentation of that test.
* Christine: project health or status - project actively maintained… e.g. repostatus.org … active, inactive, unsupported, etc… 
    * The guidance could be “be transparent” about active / inactive status.
    * “Code is produced to show a point; showing your work is important; transparency; but no guarantee code will be maintained.”
* Christine: In topics - operations - some things you do the first time and others are on-going maintenance. Awareness of ongoing maintenance topics… How do you look into the security scans, private logs, etc… 
    * David: for a lot of OS software it’s specific libraries - and they only release source code… they aren’t responsible for production… 
    * Dan: i mean security scans, etc… 
    * Christine: “people who may be using this…” - different personas.
    * Roy: a few process related policies - github advanced security, dependency review should be enabled, secret scanning, … as long as it’s something that the SCM is supporting then it should be in scope.
    * Dan: another high-level topic…
* Personas: person who is managing a bunch of github orgs; a project maintainer; person running the operations task; responding to requests that come in “i want to be added to the organization.”; developer who is using a repo on a day to day basis
* Jay: working on a taxonomy… that spans across all things… under one umbrella… Will get a draft and circulate. 
    * **Securing critical projects** & **securing software repos** working groups… could have input…
    * David: **SLSA** folks have a number of things about source as well as build…
* “Dogfooding” - we should be making sure OpenSSF repo configuration matches… 
* Roy: we can use legitify - if you are an owner of the OpenSSF github org…

Agenda



* Welcome new friends
    * Thomas Nyman - works product security
    * Jonathan L. (Linux Foundation) - security research - interested in bulk request generation
    * Siddharth - has lots of C/C++ background
    * Dan Appelquist - Snyk - we lots of products, some address that community
    * James Fuller - Red Hat security
    * George Kunz - Ericcssson Open Source Program Office
    * Marta Rybczynska
    * Diana Carroll
* Is someone willing to scribe for the meeting?
    * David A. Wheeler
* Call for opens (list new items below)
    * Thomas Nyman - we create guidance for internal use, we have been putting this guidance together, realized it might be useful to contribute Eriksson’s document. Ours is a starting point. It’d be nice to turn on all the flags, but that’s not reasonable - identify priorities, discuss when you should/shouldn’t. The compiler documentation can be difficult to understand. Where should it be expanded?
* Process
    * Generally we start in a Google document to allow multiple edits
    * Often then eventually switch to GitHub markdown once it’s more ready, to enable more control
    * Eriksson already has a Markdown format, the original was in Word
    * Jonathan L: There’s a live Markdown editor, I don’t remember the name. Etherpad? No - hackmd
    * If it’s already in Markdown, let’s just put it in GitHub.
* Walked through Eriksson’s Markdown draft
    * “Toolchain hardening” may be misleading, this isn’t build system protection. “Compiler protection” has the same problem. “Binary hardening” doesn’t cover static analysis.
    * Footnotes as single numbers, that’s mysterious, maybe switch to tags
    * “Not to do” - rename to Caveats? Contraindicators? [David W: I like “Caveats”, it’s a nice short word.]
    * Maybe ask gcc/clang folks what word is appropriate
    * If your OSS can’t compile with these options, that’s a problem, so they need to be compatible, so you need to TEST with these options.
    * Discouraged - context-specific
    * Make a “TL;DR” paragraph of just “all the flags” that someone can copy/paste into their build process.
    * Jonathan W - To tell when an option was added I either check the release notes for "new warning added" docs, or I `git blame` on the GCC manual sources :-) Somebody started documenting in which GCC release new warnings were added in this page [https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/WarningHistory](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/WarningHistory) 
    * Separately list static analysis; binary hardening; sanitizers.
    * We could add the Intel C compiler. The Microsoft C compiler has a completely different set of option flags - if we ever did that, that should be a separate document (maybe with the same structure).
    * Languages other than C/C++ typically have a tiny set of flags.
    * Some flags are more prototypes / experimental, we only want to use stable options that are okay to use in production.
    * David W: Let’s consider starting with the Ericsson document, merge in some of the other material we have.
* Everyone: I need your GitHub id, so we can get people added.
* Next time, we’ll look at the existing draft document & any other documents/materials, so we can figure out next steps.
* Is anyone interested in co-leading this project?
* Review existing issue [97 ](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/97)and early OpenSSF [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SslnJuqbFUyTFnhzkhC_Q3PPGZ1zrG89COrS6LV6pz4/edit) and Eriksson’s work
* Next steps

Agenda



* Welcome new friends (see below)
* Is someone willing to scribe for the meeting?
* Call for opens (list new items below)
* Sub-project updates (as needed)
    * C/C++ BP Guide meetings starting tomorrow (we’ll use this zoom link if the calendar invite is not ready)
* CRob updated the top of this agenda to include more sub-group info/links (will get outstanding items later this week).
* Update on SCM BP Guide
* Do we have any items we’d like to share at the upcoming townhall or do we desire to share anything at OSS-NA OSSF Day?
* 

<h3>New Friends</h3>




* Tabatha from G-Research … OSPO 
* Gail McCommons - Comcast - OSPO - On board for OpenChain.
* Joe Sepi from IBM

<h3>Opens</h3>




* CVE Issuance Guidance for Vendored Dependencies

<h3>Meeting Notes</h3>




* Source Code Management - meeting will be next week, Feb 23, 10am Eastern Time
* There will be an OpenSSF Town Hall meeting, targeting March. Anyone interested in sharing something as part of the Town Hall?
    * David: Let’s share course & best practices badge numbers
    * DEI: We could bring up what we’re actively doing
    * Jon L: Talked with Justin Hutchings - if you vendor a dependency & that dependency can’t be updated by an end-user, then YOU as a maintainer own its vulnerabilities. You need to be re-issuing the software on vulnerabilities, note that it’s part of it. Maybe include that in best practices?
        * David: Maybe add that as a point here: [https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/blob/main/docs/Concise-Guide-for-Developing-More-Secure-Software.md#readme](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/blob/main/docs/Concise-Guide-for-Developing-More-Secure-Software.md#readme) … and link to more details.
        * Jon: I can draft a proposal to share with the group
        * Maybe that proposal should be linked-to from the best practice for developing software AND for vulnerability disclosure.
    * Targeting March 16th for the town hall. OpenSSF Day will be May 10th, CFP up soon, draft CFP at: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WoaRqbQ8zNlrIuGO_3MnOXLswlqyuDvCwZAD1mcaMwY/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WoaRqbQ8zNlrIuGO_3MnOXLswlqyuDvCwZAD1mcaMwY/edit?usp=sharing)
* Vendoring
    * Creating containers & virtual machine images also have the issue, but they don’t consider calling what they do “vendoring” - this is a larger scope than it might appears.
*

<h4>Notes/Opens</h4>




* Crob is needs a co-leader for this group - Christine and Dan to be co-leads. We change the meeting time to Thursdays at same time-slot.
* Crob merged the PR - [https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/tree/main/docs/SCM-BestPractices](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/tree/main/docs/SCM-BestPractices)
* Working mode - we put things into a google document when heavy changes are being made - after that PRs and issues - however we can work on it now through PRs and issues.
* The content is currently in many subdirectories… 
* Feeling it might be easier to go into a google doc first…
* Taking a step back - easier to do outside of the yaml file…
* Christine create a doc inside of her org using legitify as inspiration … preamble 
* Topics - e.g. “managing access” - 
* Combine the list of policies we’d like to describe… 
* “Show me how” “Troubleshooting”...
* Put some labels on each policy… arrange the final document in several different ways… “First time repo”, “Access” - etc.. then curate the arrangement… 
* 
* 
* Noam - they received a contribution that changes the wording slightly.  Currently, policy -> violation, flip to show recommendation 1st.  They will be adding unique ids for policies in the future.
* Christine - it was useful to have the priority/severity levels to understand what could go wrong so she could decide whether to implement a control.  Having examples of that what could go wrong would be helpful for implementors.
    * Noam agrees.  They have some examples of threats for some of the items.  To do more broadly, we need to understand the attack surface.  (i.e. Insider threat may elevate some items, vs. external threat).

* [https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-north-america/program/cfp/?utm_content=232605818&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin&hss_channel=lcp-76521837#overview](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-north-america/program/cfp/?utm_content=232605818&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin&hss_channel=lcp-76521837#overview)  
* Sub-project updates (as needed)
* SCM BP Guide meeting (see notes below)
    * [https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/102](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/102) 
    * [https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/tree/main/docs/SCM-BestPractices](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/tree/main/docs/SCM-BestPractices) 
* C/C++ Compiler options guide (currently incubating project) - [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SslnJuqbFUyTFnhzkhC_Q3PPGZ1zrG89COrS6LV6pz4/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SslnJuqbFUyTFnhzkhC_Q3PPGZ1zrG89COrS6LV6pz4/edit) - next steps?
    * Thomas Nyman: We have an internal document about stack protectors, etc. Developers didn’t understand what mechanisms to turn on & why they should be turned on. The documentation often isn’t really accessible (understandable) to normal developers. We call it “toolchain hardening” (OWASP’s term). They also identified which versions of which compilers support it. Note which ones only work on specific architectures.
    * This is from Eriksson, product security.
    * David: I’ve informal discussion with Fedora on this, others have talked with Gentoo
    * Randall: If you want to talk with Gentoo & gcc people, I can help.
    * Thomas: We’ve already cleared release of our document under CC-BY, we’re just waiting for double-check on our current version of the document.
    * CRob will set up meeting of interested parties. Focus: C/C++ compiler hardening options for gcc/clang, probably not other compilers with different option formats (they’re really different).
* (Proposed) Stephen Hendrick (Linux Foundation) - show what have so far, how could the WG leverage LF Research  on best research
* Linux Foundation (LF) recently started up a research group, “LF Research” -[https://www.linuxfoundation.org/research](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/research)
* We went out & did a survey of contributors about best practices
* Over 500 surveyed, only 72 completely answered survey
* Expect it to go out ~4 months
* Sample size is small. However, “maintainers” is a more rarified space, don’t expect a huge number.
* URL for deck; it’s just preliminary results, so don’t broadcast it widely (“internal use only”):

<h3>Project Updates</h3>


**(please enter and speak to anything interesting)**

<h4>OpenSSF Best Practices Badge (David A. Wheeler)</h4>




* Ongoing work to upgrade to Rails 7 <[https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge/pull/1908](https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge/pull/1908)>.
* The hardened_website gold badge requirement requires enabling certain HTTP header entries, on both repo URLs and home page URLs. Users of GitHub automatically meet it for their *repo* URLs, however, many use GitHub pages for home page URLs, and those currently can’t meet the requirements without significant efforts. I”ve asked GitHub if this is something GitHub could support - we’ll see! <[https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge/issues/1878](https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge/issues/1878)>

<h4>Guide Notes</h4>




* Existing guide - contributed by Noam - They have developed an open source tool that supports github and gitlab - [https://legitify.dev/](https://legitify.dev/) - and a set of policies that it checks. Could be a good base. Can generate content to make it easier.
    * [https://github.com/Legit-Labs/legitify](https://github.com/Legit-Labs/legitify) 
* How do we want to work going forward and how do we want to communicate with the community?
* Option of doing it driven by the database of rules vs. doing it by delivering an editorial document that would be based on an initial cut of the rules.
* Who is the audience from the doc: open source maintainers; someone administering the github org; different audiences. … how to continuously monitor & manage?
* Other tools that do similar functions - compare & contrast. E.g. tools for finding secrets on github.
* Secrets could be added; but right now it’s more focused on the configuration settings. Right now it’s maintained in legitify - easy to maintain. The idea is to make it easy to contribute… includes parameters for each policy. Threat level, severity, remediation steps… 
* Separate the presentation of the doc from the maintenance - process to publish a markdown file once changes are made to the database.
* Determine scope of the tool / scope of the work.
* Long and short term very clear goals:
    * We will focus on creating a consumable document that describes the practices for securing a source code management repo.
* Dan: Focus on configuration… maybe secrets out of scope?
* General agreement to focus on configuration items.
* Current legitify process - they have a database - with descriptions… they take this and generate YAML and then from that generate Markdown. Could move the policies to an openSSF repository…
* Process for donating IP and software to the OpenSSF… we could go that way.
* What is the “why” - what is the intent in producing this guide. When they pick up the guide what are they going to get from it - what are they not going get? What’s our intent? Add focus. “Outstanding source code management.”
    * We can develop a set of user stories to help address “the why” - e.g. “As an oss maintainer I need to know how to correct and securely configure my source code repo”
* Next step: let’s get an output of the current a into a folder:
    * [https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/tree/main/docs/SCM-BestPractices](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/tree/main/docs/SCM-BestPractices) 
* Roles: open source consumer; open source maintainer; repo admin; org admin;  and user stories attached to those personas. <- vulnerabilities disclosure wg personas as a starting point
* Scope into the readme file.
* Roles into the readme file.

<h3>Agenda</h3>




* Welcome new friends
* Is someone willing to scribe for the meeting?
* Call for opens (list new items below)
* Sub-project updates (as needed) (See below)
* OSS-NA CFP May 10-12 In Vancouver, CA (CFP Closes 2/5/23)
    * [https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-north-america/program/cfp/?utm_content=232605818&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin&hss_channel=lcp-76521837#overview](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-north-america/program/cfp/?utm_content=232605818&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin&hss_channel=lcp-76521837#overview) 
* GitHub/SCM best practices guide (for forges) - getting started  -  [Issue 102](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/102)
    * What about other forges (e.g., GitLab)? Separate Git? Should there be a separate section for each SCM?
    * Issue: tech neutrality
    * E.g., if we think 2FA is a good thing (we do), could show how we do this in each.
    * Maybe need to move to markdown
    * CRob will set up a Doodle to set up a meeting to discuss & then bring back to larger group.
    * Make sure you’re on our mailing list so you’ll get notified: [https://lists.openssf.org/g/openssf-wg-best-practices](https://lists.openssf.org/g/openssf-wg-best-practices)

<h3>Project Updates</h3>


**(please enter and speak to anything interesting)**

<h4>OpenSSF Best Practices Badge (David A. Wheeler)</h4>




* We’re doing an update of the libraries (updated rubocop, Rails 6->7, etc.)

<h4>Security Fundamentals Course (David A. Wheeler)</h4>




* Making several minor updates, see the pull requests
* [https://github.com/ossf/secure-sw-dev-fundamentals/pulls](https://github.com/ossf/secure-sw-dev-fundamentals/pulls)
* Japanese translation was announced at OSSF Day, Japan.
  
* Many there were excited. Will be committed to the original fundamentals course repository. The translation was done on an older version, it’ll be updated.
* Future translations are being discussed, nothing final yet.

<h4>SKF(Glenn)</h4>




* Still working and brainstorming on the new SKF features. 25 labs were fixed and updated to the new styling. Fixed writeups.
* The fundamentals course will be integrated into SKF. Currently there is a manual-made integration of the course into the framework.  The plan is for SKF to figure out an HTML comment format, the comments will be added to the course, then they can just copy the text in.

<h4>Inventory & Allstar (spyros)</h4>




* (spyros not here today)

<h3>Scorecard (Laurent - Azeem)</h3>




* 

EDU.SIG (CRob + SIG)



* FULL SIG [Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lt8uGpiMFfgws8VF36xtTMaJAeHufha-7Dqz1tjrPGY/edit#heading=h.omyjy2x7t74i)
* CRob to present plian to the TAC on 24 Jan; it is mostly locked down at this point
* Jay and Christine have kicked off a DEI subgroup; meetings are on the OSSF calendar
    * There’s lots of interest
    * Decided to pull out into its own subgroup.
    * Intend to reach out to many other organizations, find opportunities for mentorship etc. Hopefully real impact.
    * Official invite will be going out, will send to slack/mailing list / GitHub repo
    * As always, all are welcome to participate.
    * If you’re interested in this, contact Jay & Christine.
* Intel has provided CRob a list of educational materials, will be discussing contributing some training content for the EDU SIG, CRob to follow-up
    * Maybe C/C++ compiler flags document related
    * Jay: Is there a list of what’s desired? Not yet, the plan specifically notes the need to create such a list.
        * FYI - The SIG created a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14g7jdt-e-AV1aeFFDKpPkyUh3ljPhC2kalaojMurqBU/edit?usp=sharing) to track educational materials
    * Eric: Plan is in GitHub, that’ s how the TAC wants it. Please file issues/PRs.
    * Did the plan discuss open data in Intel? Haven’t gotten that far yet.
    * We do have a spreadsheet for tracking educational materials - [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14g7jdt-e-AV1aeFFDKpPkyUh3ljPhC2kalaojMurqBU/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14g7jdt-e-AV1aeFFDKpPkyUh3ljPhC2kalaojMurqBU/edit?usp=sharing)
* Open Source Summit will be in Vancouver, May 10-12, 2023. CRob: I think OpenSSF should be there presenting lots of materials.
    * Feb 5 is deadline for submission of paper to SupplyChainSecurityCon [https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-north-america/about/supplychainsecuritycon/](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-north-america/about/supplychainsecuritycon/)
