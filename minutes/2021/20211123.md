Meeting Notes:

* Introduce any new friends
* Great MFA Distribution Project
    * Big issue: Google’s coupon codes expire at the END OF THIS YEAR, so we need to HURRY if we want to use them. The set is worth about $15K, so it’d be a shame to lose them.
    * David A. Wheeler has made changes to repo that propose a schedule to meet this hurried date &lt;[https://github.com/ossf/great-mfa-project](https://github.com/ossf/great-mfa-project)>. It’s very aggressive, but it seems possible - we should at least try. Even if we only get some distributed, that’s more than 0.
    * WE NEED YOUR HELP. We need help in completing a list of critical projects & docs on how to use them by 2021-12-02, volunteer “notifiers” to notify projects, etc. See below. If there are other jobs to be done, please let us know!!
    * Proposed schedule:
        * We'll use a list of about 100 critical open source software (OSS) projects as identified by the [OpenSSF Securing Critical Projects Working Group](https://github.com/ossf/wg-securing-critical-projects); see [their current list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ONZ4qeMq8xmeCHX03lIgIYE4MEXVfVL6oj05lbuXTDM/edit#gid=0). We'll use the version as of 2021-12-02, since the Google coupon codes expire on 2021-12-31.
        * We'll also develop a set of simple documents on how to use these tokens for common OSS cases, by 2021-12-02
        * Identified critical OSS projects will be sent at [invitation](https://github.com/ossf/great-mfa-project/blob/main/invitation.md) by one of the great-mfa-plan notifiers (e.g., John Naulty, David A. Wheeler), typically by filing an issue, in 2021-12-02..09.
        * When a project accepts, the notifier will tell a sender (David A. Wheeler or Jory Burson) key information: the project who has accepted, the email address to send private information to, and how the project accepted. The sender will then send the project the coupon codes and validation codes using the [coupon_sending.md](https://github.com/ossf/great-mfa-project/blob/main/coupond_code.md) template. This is 2021-12-03..31.
        * Projects distribute the codes. Receivers use them to get the tokens from the Google Store or GitHub shop. Then the tokens get used!
        * Projects send back some information, that we combine with other data and determine whether or not we've had a positive effect (hopefully we have!).
    * Minor issue, we think resolved: Learned that GitHub doesn’t want to send us coupon codes directly, to ensure that they’re really distributed to different people. Worked with Xavier; GitHub will send “validation codes”; each user will use a GitHub web page to convert a validation code into a coupon code. The purpose is to ensure legal compliance & getting metrics.
    * GitHub wants a short blurb from the project. Proposed text:
        * The Great Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) project, a project of the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF), is intended to prevent supply chain attacks involving weak or compromised credentials (passwords) of developers of open source software. The ["Backstabber's Knife Collection: A Review of Open Source Software Supply Chain Attack" by Ohm et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09535) noted that this is one way to subvert open source software (OSS), e.g., its source code (in a force) or its package (in a package repository). For example, [Malware found in coa and rc, two npm packages with 23M weekly downloads", 2021-11-05](https://therecord.media/malware-found-in-coa-and-rc-two-npm-packages-with-23m-weekly-downloads/) and the [Popular NPM package UA-Parser-JS poisoned with cryptomining, password-stealing malware"](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/popular-npm-package-ua-parser-js-poisoned-with-cryptomining-password-stealing-malware).
        * 
    * Issue: are we measuring enough? The right things?
        * Current requirements:
            * How many of recipients didn't have an MFA hardware token before, and
            * How many people used the Google coupon codes to receive an MFA token (we can separately get the total counts for the GitHub validation codes)
        * Probably should ask for slightly different numbers. Do we anticipate giving at most 1 token from each source to an individual (if not, how do we reword)? The Google & GitHub tokens may be sent at different times, and we should probably just ask for all the numbers we need (even from GitHub). E.g.:
            * How many people received a token from just Google, just GitHub, and from both (3 numbers)?
            * How many people didn’t have any tokens before who received a token from just Google, just GitHub, and from both (3 more numbers)?
        * If we just plan to distribute tokens to projects (multiple tokens per person possible, because people are more likely to depend on tokens if they have backup tokens), maybe we instead ask for:
            * How many tokens did you distribute from just Google? From just GitHub?
            * How many people received tokens from just Google? From just GitHub? From both?
            * How many people didn’t have hardware tokens they used for OSS who received tokens from just Google? From just GitHub? From both?
        * Any other suggestions/volunteers?
            * CRob will create a comm plan - draft by EOD tomorrow
            * Token docs: Titan easy with tokens - please add PRs!
            * Arnaud: GitHub setup Titan key - Arnaud will add links as PRs
                * https://www.yubico.com/github for Github config

                * Good to have both text and videos
                * Video “Connect to GitHub without a password”: Anchor to 10:22 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2gXo-T4wqA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2gXo-T4wqA) 
            * CRob will add some software token data
            * David will work to help critical projects
            * Glenn ten Cate: We had talked about Q&A, e.g., backup/recovery when the token breaks. Will write up something on backup/recovery.
                * For GitHub: [https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/recovering-your-account-if-you-lose-your-2fa-credentials](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/recovering-your-account-if-you-lose-your-2fa-credentials)
