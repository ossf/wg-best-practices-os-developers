Scorecard

- V3 Release upcoming; providing 0-10 scoring; enabling as a github action
  - Xav asks why shift to one score? - team got some user feedback, also looking for way to show users if a project is compliant with policies.
  - Score is a policy view of the results (Xav - changes seem directed to make tool more actionable for users)
  - Team will do demo for WG in ~ 2wks

**WG collaboration:**

- Any updates for our “Existing Guidelines for Developing and Distributing Secure Software” - [Existing Guidelines for Developing and Distributing Secure Software](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11bRB-Q_j9sj19EEC32-ijMiEHERPRwZRVWE9HwNr2pc/edit)
- Great 2FA giveaway project
  1.
- Next project will be “newbies view” for secure coding and practices - will leverage our SKF “one-pager” as a reference to structure the deck. 2.

  - Working to teach ML how to detect sec vulns in JavaScript source code
    - Ned more data
  - Using Natural Language Processing to scrub ~8000 commits
  - “Are security-relevant commits informative?” - YES!§
    - See 3 patterns - Poorly documented, misspelling issues, & non-security related notes
      - Practices & templates to create better security commit messages would be helpful
  - “How to write a good security commit message? Are there sources/guidelines available?”
    - For general commits, yes, security not so much
    - Created SECOM template to help solve this problem
    -
- Next call Arnaud will talk about Hyperledger & WG intersection
