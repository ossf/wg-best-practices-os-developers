Scorecard

* V3 Release upcoming; providing 0-10 scoring; enabling as a github action
    * Xav asks why shift to one score? - team got some user feedback, also looking for way to show users if a project is compliant with policies.
    * Score is a policy view of the results (Xav - changes seem directed to make tool more actionable for users)
    * Team will do demo for WG in ~ 2wks

**WG collaboration:**

* Any updates for our “Existing Guidelines for Developing and Distributing Secure Software” - [Existing Guidelines for Developing and Distributing Secure Software](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11bRB-Q_j9sj19EEC32-ijMiEHERPRwZRVWE9HwNr2pc/edit)
* Great 2FA giveaway project
    1. 
* Next project will be “newbies view” for secure coding and practices - will leverage our SKF “one-pager” as a reference to structure the deck.

    * Working to teach ML how to detect sec vulns in JavaScript source code
        * Ned more data
    * Using Natural Language Processing to scrub ~8000 commits
    * “Are security-relevant commits informative?” - YES!§
        * See 3 patterns - Poorly documented, misspelling issues, & non-security related notes
            * Practices & templates to create better security commit messages would be helpful
    * “How to write a good security commit message? Are there sources/guidelines available?”
        * For general commits, yes, security not so much
        * Created SECOM template to help solve this problem
        * 
* Next call Arnaud will talk about Hyperledger & WG intersection
